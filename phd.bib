	abstract = {Euclid and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) are poised to dramatically change the astronomy landscape early in the next decade. The combination of high-cadence, deep, wide-field optical photometry from {LSST} with high-resolution, wide-field optical photometry, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from Euclid will be powerful for addressing a wide range of astrophysical questions. We explore Euclid/{LSST} synergy, ignoring the political issues associated with data access to focus on the scientific, technical, and financial benefits of coordination. We focus primarily on dark energy cosmology, but also discuss galaxy evolution, transient objects, solar system science, and galaxy cluster studies. We concentrate on synergies that require coordination in cadence or survey overlap, or would benefit from pixel-level co-processing that is beyond the scope of what is currently planned, rather than scientific programs that could be accomplished only at the catalog level without coordination in data processing or survey strategies. We provide two quantitative examples of scientific synergies: the decrease in photo-z errors (benefiting many science cases) when high-resolution Euclid data are used for {LSST} photo-z determination, and the resulting increase in weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratio from smaller photo-z errors. We briefly discuss other areas of coordination, including high-performance computing resources and calibration data. Finally, we address concerns about the loss of independence and potential cross-checks between the two missions and the potential consequences of not collaborating.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky
continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 {GHz}. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter Λ{CDM} model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\%
(simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter
(θ*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the
multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the Λ{CDM}
model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure
formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in
combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The {CLASH} cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 {CLASH} clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive ({kT} {\textgreater} 5 {keV}) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (θEin {\textgreater} 35'' at zs = 2)
to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z {\textgreater} 7) galaxies. A total of 16 broadband filters, spanning the near-{UV} to near-{IR}, are employed for each 20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise (σ z {\textasciitilde} 0.02(1 + z)) photometric redshifts for newly discovered arcs. Observations of each cluster are spread over eight epochs to enable a search for Type Ia supernovae at z {\textgreater} 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of supernovae. We present newly re-derived X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and Fe abundances for the {CLASH} clusters as well as a representative source list for {MACS}1149.6+2223 (z = 0.544).},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB})
anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and
polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5σ level. We find good
consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter Λ{CDM}
cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base Λ{CDM}" in this paper), from polarization,
temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Ωch2 =
0.120 ± 0.001, baryon density Ωbh2 =
0.0224 ± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965
± 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 ± 0.007 (in this
abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100θ* = 1.0411 ± 0.0003. These
results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-Λ{CDM} cosmology, the inferred
(model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant
H0 = (67.4 ± 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007; and
matter fluctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811 ± 0.006.
We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-Λ{CDM}
model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation ({BAO}) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction
Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to ∑mν {\textless} 0.12 {eV}. The {CMB} spectra
continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base Λ{CDM} at over 2σ, which pulls some parameters that affect
the lensing amplitude away from the Λ{CDM} model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) {BAO} data. The joint constraint with {BAO} measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, ΩK = 0.001 ± 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia
supernovae ({SNe}), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a
cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from {BAO}, {BICEP}2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {\textless} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis
predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the
base-Λ{CDM} cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-Λ{CDM} results are in good agreement with {BAO}, {SNe}, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density
parameters), and in significant, 3.6σ, tension with local
measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

	abstract = {We study the concentration of dark matter haloes and its evolution in N-body simulations of the standard Λ cold dark matter (Λ{CDM}) cosmology. The results presented in this paper are based on four large N-body simulations with ∼10 billion particles each: the Millennium-I and -{II}, Bolshoi and {MultiDark} simulations. The {MultiDark} (or {BigBolshoi}) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state of the art of our current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter haloes in the Λ{CDM} cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets, despite the different codes, numerical algorithms and halo/subhalo finders used in our analysis. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration c(M, z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field σ(M, z), the halo concentration c(σ) shows a nearly universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well-defined scale at σ∼ 0.71. Yet, some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end (σ \&lt; 1), the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This c–σ(M, z) relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger – by a factor up to 1.5 – than previous results from smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of observations.},

	abstract = {We examine the radial entropy distribution and its scaling using 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the representative {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} cluster structure survey ({REXCESS}), a sample in the temperature range 2-9 {keV} selected in X-ray luminosity only, with no bias toward any particular morphological type. The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1000{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} in all systems and out to {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} in thirteen systems. Compared to theoretical expectations from non-radiative cosmological simulations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent excess entropy, such that the excess is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass systems. At {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible within the large observational and theoretical uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy is shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius, becoming consistent with self-similar at {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. There is a large dispersion in scaled entropy in the inner regions, apparently linked to the presence of cool cores and dynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by approximately a factor of two to 30 per cent, and the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. There are two peaks in the distribution of both inner slope and, after parameterising the profiles with a power law plus constant model, in central entropy {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. However, we are unable to distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed distribution of {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} with the present data. The distribution of outer slopes is unimodal with a median value of 0.98, and there is a clear correlation of outer slope with temperature. Renormalising the dimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}gas{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ({\textless}{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fraction variations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropy structural and scaling properties. The results are consistent with the picture of a cluster population in which entropy modification is centrally concentrated and extends to larger radii at lower mass, leading to both a radial and a mass-dependence in the gas mass fraction, but which is increasingly self-similar at large radius. The observed normalisation, however, would suggest entropy modification at least up to {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1000{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and even beyond, in all but the most massive systems. We discuss a tentative scenario to explain the observed behaviour of the entropy and gas mass fraction in the {REXCESS} sample, in which a combination of extra heating and merger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority of the population, and a smaller fraction of systems is able to develop a cool core.},

	abstract = {The total mass of a galaxy cluster is one of its most fundamental 
properties. Together with the redshift, the mass links observation and
theory, allowing us to use the cluster population to test models of
structure formation and to constrain cosmological parameters. Building
on the rich heritage from X-ray surveys, new results from
Sunyaev-Zeldovich and optical surveys have stimulated a resurgence of
interest in cluster cosmology. These studies have generally found fewer
clusters than predicted by the baseline Planck Λ{CDM} model,
prompting a renewed effort on the part of the community to obtain a
definitive measure of the true cluster mass scale. Here we review recent
progress on this front. Our theoretical understanding continues to
advance, with numerical simulations being the cornerstone of this
effort. On the observational side, new, sophisticated techniques are
being deployed in individual mass measurements and to account for
selection biases in cluster surveys. We summarise the state of the art
in cluster mass estimation methods and the systematic uncertainties and
biases inherent in each approach, which are now well identified and
understood, and explore how current uncertainties propagate into the
cosmological parameter analysis. We discuss the prospects for
improvements to the measurement of the mass scale using upcoming
multi-wavelength data, and the future use of the cluster population as a
cosmological probe.},

	abstract = {We examine the X-ray luminosity scaling relations of 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the Representative {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton {\textless}i/{\textgreater} Cluster Structure Survey ({REXCESS}). The objects are selected only in X-ray luminosity, optimally sampling the cluster luminosity function. Temperatures range from 2 to 9 {keV}, and there is no bias toward any particular morphological type. To reduce measurement scatter we extract pertinent values in an aperture corresponding to {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, estimated using the tight correlation between {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (the product of gas mass and temperature) and total mass. The data exhibit power law relations between bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and total mass, all with slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. We examine the possible causes for the steepening, finding that structural variations have little effect and that the primary driver appears to be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. Scatter about the relations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. The natural logarithmic scatter about the raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is about 70 per cent, and about the X-ray luminosity-{\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} relation it is 40 per cent. Systems with more morphological substructure show similar scatter about scaling relations than clusters with less substructure, due to the preponderance of cool core systems in the regular cluster subsample. Cool core and morphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space with respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically at the high luminosity side, the latter lying systematically at the low luminosity side. Simple exclusion of the central regions serves to reduce the scatter about the scaling relations by more than a factor of two. The scatter reduces by a similar amount with the use of the central gas density as a third parameter. Using {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} as a total mass proxy, we derive a Malmquist bias-corrected local luminosity-mass relation and compare with other recent determinations. Our results indicate that luminosity can be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has important implications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to be undertaken with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}{eROSITA}{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and ultimately for the use of the cluster population for cosmological purposes.},

Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({SZ}) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, (1−{\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater}). In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) temperature fluctuations by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} analysis of primary fluctuations in the {CMB}; for the lowest estimated values of (1−{\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial (3.7{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) for the largest estimated value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat Λ{CDM} model by combining the cluster and {CMB} constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10\%-level to 1\% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base Λ{CDM} model.},

The catalogue ({PSZ}2) is the largest {SZ}-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest systematic all-sky surveyof galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which 1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data sets, and is the first {SZ}-selected cluster survey containing {\textgreater}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} confirmed clusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of 83\% on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the estimates of the {SZ} strength parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}5{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}are robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate conversion to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} requires the use of prior information on the cluster extent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical, and X-ray data sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart match. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a population of low-redshift X-ray under-luminous clusters revealed by {SZ} selection. These objects appear in optical and {SZ} surveys with consistent properties for their mass, but are almost absent from {ROSAT} X-ray selected samples.},

	abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter Λ{CDM} cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base Λ{CDM}” in this paper). From the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} temperature data combined with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Mpc{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, a matter density parameter Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from {WMAP} polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-{GHz} polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base Λ{CDM} in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations with other astrophysical data we find {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.23 {eV}. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base Λ{CDM} we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0.002{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless} 0.11, consistent with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 2013 results and consistent with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of {BICEP}2, Keck Array, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ({BKP}) data. Adding the {BKP} {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0.002{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) ∝ {\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} potential. The addition of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = −1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} base Λ{CDM} cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} results for base Λ{CDM} are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the {JLA} sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base Λ{CDM} cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base Λ{CDM} cosmology provides an excellent description of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {CMB} observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

	abstract = {We present a model of the longwave atmospheric spectrum that improves in many  
respects widely used older models such as the microwave propagation model
({MPM}), since it is based on broadband measurements and calculations. According
to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 {THz} while including
lines up to 10 {THz}. Its primary goal is to simulate the
millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up
to {\textasciitilde}2 {THz} at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 {THz} accessible only
under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of
the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest
available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species.
The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The
excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the
line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms
based on {FTS} measurements between 170 and 1100 {GHz}: collision-induced
absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric
molecules (N 2 and O2) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All H2O lines
up to 10 {THz} are included in order to correctly account for the entire H2O
far-wing opacity below 2 {THz} for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution
does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency
cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models
used to date. Phase delays near H2O and O2 resonances are also important for
ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The
frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the
absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this
relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of
phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array
({ALMA}) project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at
microwaves ({ATM}) has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy
communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in
clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to
provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion
for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy.},

	abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, ΩM, and cosmological-constant energy density, ΩΛ, of the
universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at
redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a {SN} Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8{ΩM}-0.6{ΩΛ}{\textasciitilde}-0.2+/-0.1
in the region of interest (ΩM{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.5). For a flat
(ΩM+ΩΛ=1) cosmology we find
Ω{flatM}=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 σ statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified
systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Λ=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Λ=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Λ{\textgreater}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties.
The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is
tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift
Calán/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {NIKA}2 is a dual-band millimetre continuum camera of 2 900 kinetic inductance detectors, operating at 150 and 260 {GHz}, installed at the {IRAM} 30-m telescope in Spain. Open to the scientific community since October 2017, {NIKA}2 will provide key observations for the next decade to address a wide range of open questions in astrophysics and cosmology.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our aim is to present the calibration method and the performance assessment of {NIKA}2 after one year of observation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used a large data set acquired between January 2017 and February 2018 including observations of primary and secondary calibrators and faint sources that span the whole range of observing elevations and atmospheric conditions encountered by the {IRAM} 30-m telescope. This allowed us to test the stability of the performance parameters against time evolution and observing conditions. We describe a standard calibration method, referred to as the “Baseline” method, to translate raw data into flux density measurements. This includes the determination of the detector positions in the sky, the selection of the detectors, the measurement of the beam pattern, the estimation of the atmospheric opacity, the calibration of absolute flux density scale, the flat fielding, and the photometry. We assessed the robustness of the performance results using the Baseline method against systematic effects by comparing results using alternative methods.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We report an instantaneous field of view of 6.5′ in diameter, filled with an average fraction of 84\%, and 90\% of valid detectors at 150 and 260 {GHz}, respectively. The beam pattern is characterised by a {FWHM} of 17.6″ ± 0.1″ and 11.1″ ± 0.2″, and a main-beam efficiency of 47\%±3\%, and 64\%±3\% at 150 and 260 {GHz}, respectively. The point-source rms calibration uncertainties are about 3\% at 150 {GHz} and 6\% at 260 {GHz}. This demonstrates the accuracy of the methods that we deployed to correct for atmospheric attenuation. The absolute calibration uncertainties are of 5\%, and the systematic calibration uncertainties evaluated at the {IRAM} 30-m reference Winter observing conditions are below 1\% in both channels. The noise equivalent flux density at 150 and 260 {GHz} are of 9 ± 1 {mJy} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and 30 ± 3 {mJy} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {Taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broadfrequency range of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck {\textless}i/{\textgreater}satellite, we study the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({SZ}) and pressure profiles of 62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-month nominal survey. Careful reconstruction of the {SZ} signal indicates that most clusters are individually detected at least out to {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. By stacking the radial profiles, we have statistically detected the radial {SZ} signal out to 3 × {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, i.e., at a density contrast of about 50–100, though the dispersion about the mean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range. Our measurement is fully consistent with previous {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck {\textless}i/{\textgreater}results on integrated {SZ} fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between {SZ} and X-ray measurements inside {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Correcting for the effects of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck {\textless}i/{\textgreater}beam, we have calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. This new constraint from {SZ} measurements is consistent with the X-ray constraints from {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} in the region in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1–1] {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), and is in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. At larger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than most predictions from numerical simulations. Combining the {SZ} and X-ray observed profiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fit parameters [{\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater},{\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater},γ,α,β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ] = [6.41,1.81,0.31,1.33,4.13 ] . Using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirts we reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profile out to 3 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Within the temperature driven uncertainties, our {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck {\textless}i/{\textgreater}constraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gas fraction in halos.},

	abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {SZ} ({PSZ}) catalogue. The {PSZ} is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({SZ}) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {SZ} signal {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and matter density parameter Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} in a flat Λ{CDM} model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}–{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater} relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30\%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.75 ± 0.03, Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.29 ± 0.02, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}(Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/ 0.27){\textless}sup{\textgreater}0.3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} = 0.764 ± 0.025. The value of {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20\% (the central value from numerical simulations) we find {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}(Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/0.27){\textless}sup{\textgreater}0.3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} = 0.78 ± 0.01 and a tighter one-dimensional range {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.77 ± 0.02. We find that the larger values of {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} preferred by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}’s measurements of the primary {CMB} anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40\%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary {CMB} constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the Λ{CDM} model, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmologicalparameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make further progress in this field.},

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect ({SZE}) in the disturbed, intermediate-redshift
(z = 0.5458) galaxy cluster {MACS} J0717.5+3745, a triple-merger system
comprising four distinct, optically detected subclusters. Our 90 {GHz} {SZE}
data result in a sensitive, 34 μJy beam-1 map of the
{SZE} at 13'' effective resolution using the {MUSTANG} bolometer array on
the Green Bank Telescope ({GBT}). Our 140 and 268 {GHz} {SZE} imaging, with
resolutions of 58'' and 31'' and sensitivities of 1.8 and 3.3 {mJy}
beam-1, respectively, was obtained through observations
from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory using Bolocam. We compare
these maps to a two-dimensional pressure map derived from Chandra X-ray
observations. Our {MUSTANG} {SZE} data confirm previous indications from
Chandra of a pressure enhancement due to shock-heated, {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 20 {keV} gas
immediately adjacent to extended radio emission seen in low-frequency
radio maps of this cluster. {MUSTANG} also detects pressure substructure
that is not well constrained by the Chandra X-ray data in the remnant
core of a merging subcluster. We find that the small-scale pressure
enhancements in the {MUSTANG} data amount to {\textasciitilde}2\% of the total pressure
measured in the 140 {GHz} Bolocam observations. The X-ray inferred
pseudo-pressure template also fails on larger scales to accurately
describe the Bolocam data, particularly at the location of the
subcluster with a remnant core known to have a high line-of-sight
optical velocity of {\textasciitilde}3200 km s-1. Our Bolocam data are
adequately described when we add an additional component—not
described by a thermal {SZE} spectrum—to the X-ray template
coincident with this subcluster. Using flux densities extracted from our
model fits, and marginalizing over the X-ray spectroscopic temperature
constraints for the region, we fit a thermal + kinetic {SZE} spectrum to
our Bolocam data and find that the subcluster has a best-fit
line-of-sight proper velocity vz = 3600+3440
- 2160 km s-1, in agreement with the
optical velocity estimates for the subcluster. The probability
vz {\textless}= 0 given our measurements is 2.1\%. Repeating this
analysis using flux densities measured directly from our maps results in
a 3.4\% probability vz {\textless}= 0. We note that this tantalizing
result for the kinetic {SZE} is on resolved, subcluster scales.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1306.2307N},
	shorttitle = {The Hot and Energetic Universe},
	abstract = {This White Paper, submitted to the recent {ESA} call for science themes to 
define its future large missions, advocates the need for a
transformational leap in our understanding of two key questions in
astrophysics: 1) How does ordinary matter assemble into the large scale
structures that we see today? 2) How do black holes grow and shape the
Universe? Hot gas in clusters, groups and the intergalactic medium
dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe. To understand the
astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and assembly of
these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical
properties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray
spectroscopy with a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and
spatial resolving power compared to currently planned facilities.
Feedback from supermassive black holes is an essential ingredient in
this process and in most galaxy evolution models, but it is not well
understood. X-ray observations can uniquely reveal the mechanisms
launching winds close to black holes and determine the coupling of the
energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to the effects of
feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires
knowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through
cosmic time, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray
emission is the most reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but
deep survey speed must improve by a factor {\textasciitilde}100 over current facilities
to perform a full census into the early Universe. The Advanced Telescope
for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena+) mission provides the necessary
performance (e.g. angular resolution, spectral resolution, survey grasp)
to address these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the
Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will also provide a
powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.},

and group-sized haloes, extracted from Λ cold dark matter
(Λ{CDM}) cosmological N-body and hydrodynamic simulations, and
their velocity dispersion at different redshifts from z = 2 to 0. The
main aim of this analysis is to understand how the implementation of
baryonic physics in simulations affects such relations, i.e. to what
extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster mass
determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the baryonic
physics. In our analysis, we use several sets of simulations with
different physics implemented: one {DM}-only simulation, one simulation
with non-radiative gas, and two radiative simulations, one of which with
feedback from active galactic nuclei. Velocity dispersions are
determined using three different tracers: {DM} particles, subhaloes and
galaxies.

We confirm that {DM} particles trace a relation that is fully consistent
with the theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem,
σv ∝ Mα with α = 1/3, and
with previous results presented in the literature. On the other hand,
subhaloes and galaxies trace steeper relations, with velocity dispersion
scaling with mass with α {\textgreater} 1/3, and with larger values of the
normalization. Such relations imply that galaxies and subhaloes have a
∼10 per cent velocity bias relative to the {DM} particles, which can
be either positive or negative, depending on the halo mass, redshift and
physics implemented in the simulation.

We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely
dynamical friction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and
galaxies, but not on {DM} particles. These processes appear to be more or
less effective, depending on the halo masses and the importance of
baryon cooling, and may create a non-trivial dependence of the velocity
bias and the σ1D-M200 relation on the
tracer, the halo mass and its redshift.

These results are relevant in view of the application of velocity
dispersion as a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large
redshift surveys.},

	abstract = {In the 20+ years of Doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovered a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet-planet interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance ({MMR}). An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further computational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter space (∼7 × number of planets) that can have complex parameter correlations, particularly for systems near a {MMR}. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential evolution {MCMC} ({DEMCMC}) algorithm applied to radial velocity data while incorporating self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body {DEMCMC} ({RUN} {DMC}) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of the traditional {MCMC} by using an ensemble of Markov chains to adaptively improve the proposal distribution. {RUN} {DMC} can sample more efficiently from high-dimensional parameter spaces that have strong correlations between model parameters. We describe the methodology behind the algorithm, along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We find that most algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However, the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to the details of individual planetary systems (e.g., number of planets, number of observations, orbital periods, and signal-to-noise of each planet), we offer recommendations for choosing the {DEMCMC} algorithm's algorithmic parameters that result in excellent performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.},

As a few pioneering studies have already shown, {SZ} observations both complement X-ray observations—the traditional tool for studying the intra-cluster medium—and bring unique capabilities for probing astrophysical processes at high redshifts and out to the low-density regions in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Advances in {SZ} observations have largely been driven by developments in centimetre-, millimetre-, and submillimetre-wave instrumentation on ground-based facilities, with notable exceptions including results from the Planck satellite. Here we review the utility of the thermal, kinematic, relativistic, non-thermal, and polarised {SZ} effects for studies of galaxy clusters and other large scale structures, incorporating the many advances over the past two decades that have impacted {SZ} theory, simulations, and observations. We also discuss observational results, techniques, and challenges, and aim to give an overview and perspective on emerging opportunities, with the goal of highlighting some of the exciting new directions in this field.},

We developed and applied a matched multi-filter ({MMF}) capable of dealing with the different transfer functions and resolutions of the two datasets. We verified that it produces results consistent with publications from Planck and {SPT} collaborations when applied on the datasets individually. We also verified that Planck and {SPT}-{SZ} cluster fluxes are consistent with each other. When applied blindly to the combined dataset, the {MMF} generated a catalog of 419 detections (S/N \&gt; 5), of which 323 are already part of the {SPT}-{SZ} or {PSZ}2 catalogs; 54 are new {SZ} detections, which have been identified in other catalogs or surveys; and 42 are new unidentified candidates. The {MMF} takes advantage of the complementarity of the two datasets, Planck being particularly useful for detecting clusters at a low redshift (z \&lt; 0.3), while {SPT} is efficient at finding higher redshift (z \&gt; 0.3) sources. This work represents a proof of concept that blind cluster extraction can be performed on combined, inhomogeneous millimeter datasets acquired from space and ground. This result is of prime importance for planned ground-based cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) experiments (e.g., Simons Observatory, {CMB}-S4) and envisaged {CMB} space missions (e.g., {PICO}, Backlight) that will detect hundreds of thousands of clusters in the low mass regime (M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}500{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} ≤ 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}14{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}), for which the various sources of intra-cluster emission (gas, dust, synchrotron) will be of the same order of magnitude and hence require broad ground and space frequency coverage with a comparable spatial resolution for adequate separation. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The catalogue is only available at the {CDS} via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/647/A106"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/647/A106{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We evaluate its performance in terms of completeness, contamination rate and photometric recovery for three representative types of {SZ} survey: a high resolution single frequency radio survey ({AMI}), a high resolution ground-based multiband survey ({SPT}), and the Planck all-sky survey. These surveys are not purely flux limited, and they loose completeness significantly before their point-source detection thresholds.
Contamination remains relatively low at {\textless}5\% (less than 30\%) for a detection threshold set at S/N=5 (S/N=3). We identify photometric recovery as an important source of catalog uncertainty: dispersion in recovered flux from multiband surveys is larger than the intrinsic scatter in the Y-M relation predicted from hydrodynamical simulations, while photometry in the single frequency survey is seriously compromised by confusion with primary cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The latter effect implies that follow-up observations in other wavebands (e.g., 90 {GHz}, X-ray) of single frequency surveys will be required. Cluster morphology can cause a bias in the recovered Y-M relation, but has little effect on the scatter; the bias would be removed during calibration of the relation. Point source confusion only slightly decreases multiband survey completeness; single frequency survey completeness could be significantly reduced by radio point source confusion, but this remains highly uncertain because we do not know the radio counts at the relevant flux levels.},

employed here consists of Chandra observations of 40 such clusters,
identified in a comprehensive search of the Chandra archive for hot ({kT}
≳ 5 {keV}), massive, morphologically relaxed systems, as well as
high-quality weak gravitational lensing data for a subset of these
clusters. Here we present cosmological constraints from measurements of
the gas mass fraction, fgas, for this cluster sample. By
incorporating a robust gravitational lensing calibration of the X-ray
mass estimates, and restricting our measurements to the most
self-similar and accurately measured regions of clusters, we
significantly reduce systematic uncertainties compared to previous work.
Our data for the first time constrain the intrinsic scatter in
fgas, 7.4 ± 2.3 per cent in a spherical shell at radii
0.8-1.2 r2500 (∼1/4 of the virial radius), consistent
with the expected level of variation in gas depletion and non-thermal
pressure for relaxed clusters. From the lowest redshift data in our
sample, five clusters at z {\textless} 0.16, we obtain a constraint on a
combination of the Hubble parameter and cosmic baryon fraction,
h3/2 Ωb/Ωm = 0.089 ±
0.012, that is insensitive to the nature of dark energy. Combining this
with standard priors on h and Ωbh2 provides
a tight constraint on the cosmic matter density, Ωm =
0.27 ± 0.04, which is similarly insensitive to dark energy. Using
the entire cluster sample, extending to z {\textgreater} 1, we obtain consistent
results for Ωm and interesting constraints on dark
energy: Ω \_\{\{Λ \}\}=0.65{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.22\}{\textgreater} for non-flat
Λ{CDM} (cosmological constant) models, and w = -0.98 ± 0.26
for flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state. Our
results are both competitive and consistent with those from recent
cosmic microwave background, Type Ia supernova and baryon acoustic
oscillation data. We present constraints on more complex models of
evolving dark energy from the combination of fgas data with
these external data sets, and comment on the possibilities for improved
fgas constraints using current and next-generation X-ray
observatories and lensing data.},

In the first four years of scientific operation after its launch, foreseen for 2014, it will perform a deep survey of the entire X-ray sky. In the soft X-ray band (0.5-2 {keV}), this will be about 20 times more sensitive than the {ROSAT} all sky survey, while in the hard band (2-10 {keV}) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky at those energies. Such a sensitive all-sky survey will revolutionize our view of the high-energy sky, and calls for major efforts in synergic,
multi-wavelength wide area surveys in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of the X-ray data. The design-driving science of {eROSITA} is the detection of very large samples ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}5 objects) of galaxy clusters out to redshifts z{\textgreater}1, in order to study the large scale structure in the Universe, test and characterize cosmological models including Dark Energy. {eROSITA} is also expected to yield a sample of around 3 millions Active Galactic Nuclei, including both obscured and un-obscured objects, providing a unique view of the evolution of supermassive black holes within the emerging cosmic structure. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including accreting binaries, active stars and diffuse emission within the Galaxy, as well as solar system bodies that emit X-rays via the charge exchange process. Finally, such a deep imaging survey at high spectral resolution, with its scanning strategy sensitive to a range of variability timescales from tens of seconds to years, will undoubtedly open up a vast discovery space for the study of rare, unpredicted, or unpredictable high-energy astrophysical phenomena.

	abstract = {We present the results of an X-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clusters selected in the 2500 deg2 South Pole Telescope survey and observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We divide the full sample into subsamples of ∼20 clusters based on redshift and central density, performing a joint X-ray spectral fit to all clusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the temperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the temperature profile over 0 {\textless} r {\textless} 1.5R 500, which would be impossible on a per-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on average, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first constraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z = 0 to z = 1.2. We find that high-z (0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2) clusters are slightly (∼30\%) cooler both in the inner (r {\textless} 0.1R 500) and outer (r {\textgreater} R 500) regions than their low-z (0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with measured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average pressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Confirming earlier results from this data set, we find an absence of strong cool cores at high z, manifested in this analysis as a significantly lower observed pressure in the central 0.1R 500 of the high-z cool-core subset of clusters compared to the low-z cool-core subset. Overall, our observed pressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements, suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the core. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at r ≲ 0.7R 500—this may reflect a long-standing balance between cooling and feedback over long timescales and large physical scales. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r ≳ R 500 in our high-z subsample. This flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due to the enhanced (∼3×) rate at which group-mass (∼2 {keV}) halos, which would go undetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z ∼ 1. This work demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially resolved cluster properties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but the number of observed clusters is high.},

In the centers of clusters (), we find significant deviations from self-similarity (), consistent with no redshift dependence. When we isolate clusters with overdense cores (i.e., cool cores), we find that the average overdensity profile has not evolved with redshift—that is, cool cores have not changed in size, density, or total mass over the past ∼9–10 Gyr. We show that the evolving “cuspiness” of clusters in the X-ray, reported by several previous studies, can be understood in the context of a cool core with fixed properties embedded in a self-similarly evolving cluster. We find no measurable evolution in the X-ray morphology of massive clusters, seemingly in tension with the rapidly rising (with redshift) rate of major mergers predicted by cosmological simulations. We show that these two results can be brought into agreement if we assume that the relaxation time after a merger is proportional to the crossing time, since the latter is proportional to .},

Our sample, from an area of 504 deg2 centered on the celestial equator, is divided into two regions. The main region uses 270 deg2 of the {ACT} survey that overlaps with the co-added ugriz imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) over Stripe 82 plus additional near-infrared pointed observations with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope. We confirm a total of 49 clusters to z ≈ 1.3, of which 22 (all at z {\textgreater} 0.55) are new discoveries. For the second region, the regular-depth {SDSS} imaging allows us to confirm 19 more clusters up to z ≈ 0.7, of which 10 systems are new. We present the optical richness, photometric redshifts, and separation between the {SZ} position and the brightest cluster galaxy ({BCG}). We find no significant offset between the cluster {SZ} centroid and {BCG} location and a weak correlation between optical richness and {SZ}-derived mass. We also present X-ray fluxes and luminosities from the {ROSAT} All Sky Survey which confirm that this is a massive sample. One of the newly discovered clusters, {ACT}-{CL} J0044.4+0113 at z = 1.1 (photometric), has an integrated {XMM}-Newton X-ray temperature of {kTX} = 7.9 ± 1.0 {keV} and combined mass of M 200a = 8.2+3.3 –2.5 × 1014 h –1 70 M ☉, placing it among the most massive and X-ray-hot clusters known at redshifts beyond z = 1. We also highlight the optically rich cluster {ACT}-{CL} J2327.4–0204 ({RCS}2 2327) at z = 0.705 (spectroscopic) as the most significant detection of the whole equatorial sample with a Chandra-derived mass of M 200a = 1.9+0.6 –0.4 × 1015 h –1 70 M ☉, placing it in the ranks of the most massive known clusters like El Gordo and the Bullet Cluster.},

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time ({LSST}) by the {LSST} Dark Energy Science Collaboration ({LSST} {DESC}). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of {LSST}; the {DC}2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up {LSST}-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's {LSST} Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated {DC}2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg2, as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The {DC}2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the {LSST} {DESC} working groups can use the data set to develop a range of {DESC} analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for {LSST} by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the {DC}2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.},

In this paper we propose to combine these two observables and show that it is possible to calibrate the masses of the full Stage-4 cluster catalog internally owing to the high signal to noise measurement of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) lensing convergence field. We find that a {CMB} Stage-4 experiment will constrain the hydrostatic bias parameter to sub-percent accuracy. We also show constraints on a nonparametric Y−M relationship which could be used to study its evolution with mass and redshift. Finally we present a joint likelihood for thermal {SZ} ({tSZ}) flux and mass measurements, and show that it could lead to a ∼5σ detection of the lower limit on the sum of the neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy (∑mν=60 {meV}) once combined with measurements of the primordial {CMB} and {CMB} lensing power spectra assuming a cosmic-variance-limited measurement of the optical depth to reionization.},

Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\textasciitilde}27.5. The {LSST} Science Book describes the basic parameters of the {LSST} hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that {LSST} will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\textasciitilde}1, strong and weak lensing, the
large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

	abstract = {This white paper describes the {LSST} Dark Energy Science Collaboration ({DESC}), whose goal is the study of dark energy and related topics in fundamental physics with data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}). It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the {DESC} by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological
simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for {LSST} dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the {LSST} system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for {LSST} analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the {LSST} {DESC}, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the {LSST} {DESC}.},

There are currently no representative optical weak lensing measurements of clusters that match the distance and average mass of this sample. We detect the lensing signal with a significance of . We model the signal with a halo model framework to find the mean mass of the population from which these clusters are drawn. Assuming that the clusters follow Navarro–Frenk–White ({NFW}) density profiles, we infer a mean mass of . We consider systematic uncertainties from cluster redshift errors, centering errors, and the shape of the {NFW} profile. These are all smaller than 30\% of our reported uncertainty.

	abstract = {We study a sample of 61submillimetre galaxies ({SMGs}) selected from ground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Space Observatory as part of the {PACS} Evolutionary Probe ({PEP}) and the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey ({HerMES}) guaranteed time key programmes. Our study makes use of the broad far-infrared and submillimetre wavelength coverage (100−600 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m) only made possible by the combination of observations from the {PACS} and {SPIRE} instruments aboard the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Space Observatory. Using a power-law temperature distribution model to derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dust emissivity spectral index for {SMGs} of {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2.0 ± 0.2. Our results unambiguously unveil the diversity of the {SMG} population. Some {SMGs} exhibit extreme infrared luminosities of s10 and relatively warm dust components, while others are fainter (a few times 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}12{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. Although at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}s2 classical {SMGs} ({\textgreater}5 {mJy} at 850 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m) have large infrared luminosities (s10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), objects only selected on their submm flux densities (without any redshift informations) probe a large range in dust temperatures and infrared luminosities. The extreme infrared luminosities of some {SMGs} ({\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{IR}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≳ 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}12.7{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, 26/61 systems) imply star formation rates ({SFRs}) of {\textgreater}500 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} (assuming a Chabrier {IMF} and no dominant {AGN} contribution to the {FIR} luminosity). Such high {SFRs} are difficult to reconcile with a secular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-driven stage in the evolution of these galaxies. Another observational argument in favour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than that of {SMGs} of lower luminosities (s40 K as opposed to s25 K), consistent with observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies triggered by major mergers and with results from hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfer calculations. Moreover, we find that luminous {SMGs} are systematically offset from normal star-forming galaxies in the stellar mass-{SFR} plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburst events with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. On the other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity {SMGs} have cold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of star formation, and therefore might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation. However, the properties of this latter population, especially their dust temperature, should be treated with caution because at these luminosities {SMGs} are not a representative sample of the entire star-forming galaxy population.},

For the 30-m millimeter radio telescope that is realized by thermal insulation of the telescope and temperature control of the reflector support structure and the quadrupod, allowing full performance independent of time of day or season. A description of the control system is given together with measured performance data. The additional cost of the thermal control amounts to 10 percent of the total cost of the telescope. The increase in availability with unimpaired
characteristics is estimated at a factor of 1.5-2. Calculations with a detailed thermal model are also in accordance with the measurements. Thus temperature effects can be included numerically in the structural design and be controlled to eliminate thermally induced deformations.},

	abstract = {We present constraints on extensions to the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmological 
model from measurements of the \$E\$-mode polarization auto-power spectrum
and the temperature-\$E\$-mode cross-power spectrum of the cosmic
microwave background ({CMB}) made using 2018 {SPT}-3G data. The extensions
considered vary the primordial helium abundance, the effective number of
relativistic degrees of freedom, the sum of neutrino masses, the
relativistic energy density and mass of a sterile neutrino, and the mean
spatial curvature. We do not find clear evidence for any of these
extensions, from either the {SPT}-3G 2018 dataset alone or in combination
with baryon acoustic oscillation and {\textbackslash}textit\{Planck\} data. None of these
model extensions significantly relax the tension between
Hubble-constant, \$H\_0\$, constraints from the {CMB} and from
distance-ladder measurements using Cepheids and supernovae. The addition
of the {SPT}-3G 2018 data to {\textbackslash}textit\{Planck\} reduces the square-root of
the determinants of the parameter covariance matrices by factors of \$1.3
- 2.0\$ across these models, signaling a substantial reduction in the
allowed parameter volume. We also explore {CMB}-based constraints on \$H\_0\$
from combined {SPT}, {\textbackslash}textit\{Planck\}, and {ACT} {DR}4 datasets. While
individual experiments see some indications of different \$H\_0\$ values
between the \${TT}\$, \${TE}\$, and \${EE}\$ spectra, the combined \$H\_0\$ constraints
are consistent between the three spectra. For the full combined
datasets, we report \$H\_0 = 67.49 {\textbackslash}pm
0.53{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, which is the tightest constraint
on \$H\_0\$ from {CMB} power spectra to date and in \$4.1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension
with the most precise distance-ladder-based measurement of \$H\_0\$. The
{SPT}-3G survey is planned to continue through at least 2023, with
existing maps of combined 2019 and 2020 data already having
\${\textbackslash}sim3.5{\textbackslash}times\$ lower noise than the maps used in this analysis.},

	abstract = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation ({BAO}) measurements with cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) data and a recent reanalysis of Type Ia supernova ({SN}) data. In particular, we take advantage of high-precision {BAO} measurements from galaxy clustering and the Lyman-α forest ({LyaF}) in the {SDSS}-{III} Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey ({BOSS}). Treating the {BAO} scale as an uncalibrated standard ruler, {BAO} data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy; in combination with the {CMB} angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Adding the {CMB}-calibrated physical scale of the sound horizon, the combination of {BAO} and {SN} data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a measurement of H0=67.3 ±1.1 km s-1 Mpc-1 , with 1.7\% precision.
This measurement assumes standard prerecombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with {CMB}-based estimates that assume a flat Λ {CDM}
cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For constant dark energy (Λ ), our {BAO} +{SN} +{CMB}
combination yields matter density Ωm=0.301
±0.008 and curvature Ωk=-0.003 ±0.003 .
When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the {BAO} +{SN} +{CMB} parameter constraints are always consistent with flat Λ {CDM} values at ≈1 σ . While the overall χ2 of model
fits is satisfactory, the {LyaF} {BAO} measurements are in moderate (2 - 2.5 σ ) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshift remain consistent with our expansion history constraints, and they yield a higher H0 and lower matter clustering amplitude, improving agreement with some low redshift observations. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit on the summed mass of neutrino species,
∑mν{\textless}0.56 {eV} (95\% confidence), improving to
∑mν{\textless}0.25 {eV} if we include the lensing signal in the
Planck {CMB} power spectrum. In a flat Λ {CDM} model that allows
extra relativistic species, our data combination yields
Neff=3.43 ±0.26 ; while the {LyaF} {BAO} data prefer
higher Neff when excluding galaxy {BAO}, the galaxy {BAO} alone favor Neff≈3 . When structure growth is extrapolated
forward from the {CMB} to low redshift, standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.},

We quantify the impact of uncertainties in {HMF} parameters on cosmological constraints from cluster catalogs similar to those from Planck, those expected from the Euclid, Roman, and Rubin surveys, and from a hypothetical larger future survey. We analyze simulated catalogs in each case, gradually loosening priors on {HMF} parameters to evaluate the degradation in cosmological constraints. While current uncertainties on {HMF} parameters do not substantially impact Planck-like surveys, we find that they can significantly degrade the cosmological constraints for a Euclid-like survey. Consequently, the current precision on the {HMF} is not sufficient for Euclid, Roman, Rubin or possible larger surveys. Future experiments will have to properly account for uncertainties in {HMF} parameters, and it will be necessary to improve the precision of {HMF} fits to avoid weakening constraints on cosmological parameters.},

	abstract = {We investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles with {REXCESS}, a representative sample of 33 local ({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.2) clusters drawn from the {REFLEX} catalogue and observed with {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The sample spans a mass range of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} , where {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is the mass corresponding to a density contrast of 500. We derive an average profile from observations scaled by mass and redshift according to the standard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean is remarkably low, at less than 30 per cent beyond 0.2 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, but increases towards the center. Deviations about the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state of the cluster. Morphologically disturbed systems have systematically shallower profiles while cooling core systems are more concentrated. The scaled profiles exhibit a residual mass dependence with a slope of {\textasciitilde}0.12, consistent with that expected from the empirically-derived slope of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} – {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} relation; however, the departure from standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero at {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. The scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling is smaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure is the quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics. Comparison with scaled data from several state of the art numerical simulations shows good agreement outside the core. Combining the observational data in the radial range [0.03–1] {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} with simulation data in the radial range [1–4] {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, we derive a robust measure of the universal pressure profile, that, in an analytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as a function of mass and redshift up to the cluster “boundary”. Using this profile and direct spherical integration of the observed pressure profiles, we estimate the integrated Compton parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and investigate its scaling with {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, the soft band X-ray luminosity. We consider both the spherically integrated quantity, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}sph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), proportional to the gas thermal energy, and the cylindrically integrated quantity, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}cyl{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater})={\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{SZ}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}D{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}A{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, which is directly related to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}) effect signal. From the low scatter of the observed {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}sph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) – {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} relation we show that variations in pressure profile shape do not introduce extra scatter into the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}sph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) – {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} relation as compared to that from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} – {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} relation. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}sph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) – {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}sph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) – {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} relations derived from the data are in excellent agreement with those expected from the universal profile.

These methods have to tackle some of the awkward features prevalent in astronomical data, namely heteroscedastic (point-dependent) errors, intrinsic scatter, non-ignorable data collection and selection effects, data structure and non-uniform population (often called Malmquist bias), non-Gaussian data, outliers, and mixtures of regressions. We outline how least square fits, weighted least squares methods, Maximum Likelihood, survival analysis, and Bayesian methods have been applied in the astrophysics literature when one or more of these features is present.

	abstract = {We present results of X-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selected via their imprint on the cosmic microwave background from the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich ({SZ}) effect. These clusters are a subset of the first {SZ}-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg2 of sky surveyed by the South Pole Telescope ({SPT}). Using X-ray observations with Chandra and {XMM}-Newton, we estimate the temperature, {TX}, and mass, Mg, of the intracluster medium within r500 for each cluster. From these, we calculate {YX} = {MgTX} and estimate the total cluster mass using an M500–{YX} scaling relation measured from previous X-ray studies. The integrated Comptonization, {YSZ}, is derived from the {SZ} measurements, using additional information from the X-ray-measured gas density profiles and a universal temperature profile. We calculate scaling relations between the X-ray and {SZ} observables and find results generally consistent with other measurements and the expectations from simple self-similar behavior. Specifically, we fit a {YSZ}–{YX} relation and find a normalization of 0.82 ± 0.07, marginally consistent with the predicted ratio of {YSZ}/{YX} = 0.91 ± 0.01 that would be expected from the density and temperature models used in this work. Using the {YX}-derived mass estimates, we fit a {YSZ}–M500 relation and find a slope consistent with the self-similar expectation of {YSZ}∝M5/3 with a normalization consistent with predictions from other X-ray studies. We find that the {SZ} mass estimates, derived from cosmological simulations of the {SPT} survey, are lower by a factor of 0.78 ± 0.06 relative to the X-ray mass estimates. This offset is at a level of 1.3σ when considering the ∼15\% systematic uncertainty for the simulation-based {SZ} masses. Overall, the X-ray measurements confirm that the scaling relations of the {SZ}-selected clusters are consistent with the properties of other X-ray-selected samples of massive clusters, even allowing for the broad redshift range (0.29 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.08) of the sample.},

red-shifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis.

	abstract = {This work attains a threefold objective: first, we derived the richness-mass scaling in the local Universe from data of 53 clusters with individual measurements of mass. We found a 0.46 ± 0.12 slope and a 0.25 ± 0.03 dex scatter measuring richness with a previously developed method. Second, we showed on a real sample of 250 0.06 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.9 clusters, most of which are at z \&lt; 0.3, with spectroscopic redshift that the colour of the red sequence allows us to measure the clusters' redshift to better than ∆z = 0.02. Third, we computed the predicted prior of the richness-mass scaling to forecast the capabilities of future wide-field-area surveys of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmological parameters. To this aim, we generated a simulated universe obeying the richness-mass scaling that we found. We observed it with a {PanStarrs} 1+Euclid-like survey, allowing for intrinsic scatter between mass and richness, for errors on mass, on richness, and for photometric redshift errors. We fitted the observations with an evolving five-parameter richness-mass scaling with parameters to be determined. Input parameters were recovered, but only if the cluster mass function and the weak-lensing redshift-dependent selection function were accounted for in the fitting of the mass-richness scaling. This emphasizes the limitations of often adopted simplifying assumptions, such as having a mass-complete redshift-independent sample. We derived the uncertainty and the covariance matrix of the (evolving) richness-mass scaling, which are the input ingredients of cosmological forecasts using cluster counts. We find that the richness-mass scaling parameters can be determined 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}5{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} times better than estimated in previous works that did not use weak-lensing mass estimates, although we emphasize that this high factor was derived with scaling relations with different parameterizations. The better knowledge of the scaling parameters likely has a strong impact on the relative importance of the different probes used to constrain cosmological parameters. The fitting code used for computing the predicted prior, including the treatment of the mass function and of the weak-lensing selection function, is provided in Appendix A. It can be re-used, for example, to derive the predicted prior of other observable-mass scalings, such as the L{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}X{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}-mass relation. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater} {\textless}P /{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1086/177901},
	abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with
measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter
in addition to measurement errors. The first ({BCES}) is a direct extension of
the ordinary least squares ({OLS}) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It
is quite general, allowing a) for measurement errors on both variables, b) the
measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, c) the magnitudes of
the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and d) other `symmetric'
lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed.
The second method is a weighted least squares ({WLS}) estimator, which applies
only in the case where the `independent' variable is measured without error and
the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the 'dependent' variable are
independent from the measurements. Several applications are made to
extragalactic astronomy: The {BCES} method, when applied to data describing the
color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different
slopes than {OLS} and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with
artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the
estimators. Unsurprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is
treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example
where the {BCES} method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity
are correlated due to inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations,
that the {WLS} method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness
test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude.
Moreover, with {WLS} it is not necessary to ``reduce'' galaxies to a fiducial
surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multicomponent, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multiwavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multiwavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators, and theorists.},

The maps cover more than 17,000 deg2, the deepest 600 deg2 with noise levels below 10{μK}-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg2 of these maps to constrain cosmology. The {ACT} data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the
last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, H0. By combining {ACT} data with large-scale information from {WMAP} we measure H0=67.6± 1.1 km/s/Mpc, at 68\%
confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from {ACT} alone we find
H0=67.9± 1.5 km/s/Mpc). The Λ{CDM} model provides
a good fit to the {ACT} data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1σ the number of
relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with Λ{CDM} predictions to within 1.5–2.2σ. We compare {ACT}, {WMAP}, and Planck at the parameter
level and find good consistency; we investigate how the constraints on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters readjust when adding {CMB} large-scale information that {ACT} does not measure. The {DR}4 products presented here will be publicly released on the {NASA} Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis.},

	abstract = {The Simons Observatory ({SO}) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early 2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design, and forecast its performance. {SO} will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands centered at: 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 {GHz}. The initial configuration of {SO} will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes and one large-aperture 6-m telescope, with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization. The small aperture telescopes will target the largest angular scales observable from Chile, mapping ≈ 10\% of the sky to a white noise level of 2 μK-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 {GHz} bands, to measure the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, at a target level of σ(r)=0.003. The large aperture telescope will map ≈ 40\% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected white noise level of 6 μK-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 {GHz} bands, overlapping with the majority of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope sky region and partially with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000 extragalactic sources.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} satellite data on the Coma cluster observed via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Thanks to its great sensitivity, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is able, for the first time, to detect {SZ} emission up to {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≈ 3 × {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We test previously proposed spherically symmetric models for the pressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. In particular, we find that the Arnaud et al. (2010, A\&A, 517, A92) “universal” pressure profile does not fit Coma, and that their pressure profile for merging systems provides a reasonable fit to the data only at {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}; by {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2 × {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} it underestimates the observed {\textless}i{\textgreater}y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} profile by a factor of ≃2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either: i) the cluster {SZ} emission is contaminated by unresolved {SZ} sources along the line of sight; or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} than the mean pressure profile predicted by the simulations used to constrain the models. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} image shows significant local steepening of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} profile in two regions about half a degree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features are consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the western feature was previously noticed in the {ROSAT} {PSPC} mosaic as well as in the radio. Using {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find pressure jumps of 4.9{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+0.4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and 5.0{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.1{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+1.3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in the west and south-east, respectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce that the shock waves should propagate with Mach number {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}w{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 2.03{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.04{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+0.09{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}se{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 2.05{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.02{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+0.25{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in the west and south-east, respectively. Finally, we find that the {\textless}i{\textgreater}y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc scales, with small intrinsic scatter. This implies either that the energy density of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster, or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Context. In the currently debated context of using clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes, the need for well-defined cluster samples is critical. Aims: The {XXL} Survey has been specifically designed to provide a well characterised sample of some 500 X-ray detected clusters suitable for cosmological studies. The main goal of present article is to make public and describe the properties of the cluster catalogue in its present state, as well as of associated catalogues of more specific objects such as super-clusters and fossil groups. Methods: Following from the publication of the hundred brightest {XXL} clusters, we now release a sample containing 365 clusters in total, down to a flux of a few 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2 in the [0.5-2] {keV} band and in a 1' aperture. This release contains the complete subset of clusters for which the selection function is well determined plus all X-ray clusters which are, to date, spectroscopically confirmed. In this paper, we give the details of the follow-up observations and explain the procedure adopted to validate the cluster spectroscopic redshifts. Considering the whole {XXL} cluster sample, we have provided two types of selection, both complete in a particular sense: one based on
flux-morphology criteria, and an alternative based on the [0.5-2] {keV} flux within 1 arcmin of the cluster centre. We have also provided X-ray temperature measurements for 80\% of the clusters having a flux larger
than 9 × 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2. Results: Our cluster sample extends from z 0 to z 1.2, with one
cluster at z 2. Clusters were identified through a mean number of six
spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. The largest number of
confirmed spectroscopic members in a cluster is 41. Our updated
luminosity function and luminosity-temperature relation are compatible
with our previous determinations based on the 100 brightest clusters,
but show smaller uncertainties. We also present an enlarged list of
super-clusters and a sample of 18 possible fossil groups. 
Conclusions: This intermediate publication is the last before the final
release of the complete {XXL} cluster catalogue when the ongoing C2
cluster spectroscopic follow-up is complete. It provides a unique
inventory of medium-mass clusters over a 50 deg2 area out to
z 1.

	abstract = {Galaxy cluster counts in bins of mass and redshift have been shown to be a competitive probe to test cosmological models. This method requires an efficient blind detection of clusters from surveys with a well-known selection function and robust mass estimates, which is particularly challenging at high redshift. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Euclid{\textless}i/{\textgreater} wide survey will cover 15 000 deg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} of the sky, avoiding contamination by light from our Galaxy and our solar system in the optical and near-infrared bands, down to magnitude 24 in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band. The resulting data will make it possible to detect a large number of galaxy clusters spanning a wide-range of masses up to redshift ∼2 and possibly higher. This paper presents the final results of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Euclid{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Cluster Finder Challenge ({CFC}), fourth in a series of similar challenges. The objective of these challenges was to select the cluster detection algorithms that best meet the requirements of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Euclid{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission. The final {CFC} included six independent detection algorithms, based on different techniques, such as photometric redshift tomography, optimal filtering, hierarchical approach, wavelet and friend-of-friends algorithms. These algorithms were blindly applied to a mock galaxy catalog with representative {\textless}i{\textgreater}Euclid{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-like properties. The relative performance of the algorithms was assessed by matching the resulting detections to known clusters in the simulations down to masses of {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ∼ 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13.25{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Several matching procedures were tested, thus making it possible to estimate the associated systematic effects on completeness to {\textless} 3\%. All the tested algorithms are very competitive in terms of performance, with three of them reaching {\textgreater} 80\% completeness for a mean purity of 80\% down to masses of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and up to redshift {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2. Based on these results, two algorithms were selected to be implemented in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Euclid{\textless}i/{\textgreater} pipeline, the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects ({AMICO}) code, based on matched filtering, and the {PZWav} code, based on an adaptive wavelet approach.},

Cette thèse se focalise sur l'analyse des données du satellite Planck et celles de la caméra {NIKA} installée au sol au télescope de 30 mètres de l'{IRAM}.La première partie introduit le contexte, en se concentrant sur: 1) l'inflation, qui procure une origine naturelle aux fluctuations de matière observées dans l'Univers; 2) la réionisation, qui correspond au moment où les premières étoiles se forment; 3) les amas de galaxies, qui sont les briques de l'Univers plus récent.La seconde partie se concentre sur la réduction des données de {NIKA}. Le développement de la chaîne d'analyse, qui permet de passer des données brutes aux cartes astrophysiques, est présenté. Elle est dédiée aux détecteurs à inductance cinétique, nouvellement développés pour la caméra {NIKA}. Les outils et les simulations utilisés pour caractériser les cartes sont aussi présentés.La troisième partie est dédiée à l'observation et l'analyse des amas de galaxies par effet Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}), i.e. l'interaction Compton inverse entre les photons du {CMB} et les électrons énergétiques dans les amas. Une fois obtenues, les cartes {SZ} sont combinées avec des données X afin de mesurer les propriétés thermodynamiques et de matière des amas observés. Les résultats principaux sont: la première observation de l'effet {SZ} avec des détecteurs à inductance cinétique, la mesure du profil de pression dans un amas à haut redshift (z=0.89), l'étude de la contamination par les sources ponctuelles dans un amas résolu, et la cartographie {SZ} dans un amas en collision triple.La dernière partie présente l'analyse des données de Planck en polarisation. Les effets systématiques aux grandes échelles angulaires et les outils développés pour les identifier et les corriger y sont discutés. Les données en polarisation aux grandes échelles permettent à la fois de chercher les empreintes des fluctuations quantiques générées pendant l'inflation et de mesurer la réionisation.},

Application to images from the New {IRAM} {KIDs} Array ({NIKA}) and {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton {\textless}i/{\textgreater}allows us to measure and determine the spatial distribution of the gas temperature in the merging cluster {MACS} J0717.5+3745, at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.55. Despite the complexity of the target object, we find a good morphological agreement between the temperature maps derived from X-ray spectroscopy only – using {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton {\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{XMM}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra {\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{CXO}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) – and the new gas-mass-weighted {tSZ}+X-ray imaging method ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{SZX}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). We correlate the temperatures from {tSZ}+X-ray imaging and those from X-ray spectroscopy alone and find that {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{SZX}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is higher than {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{XMM}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and lower than {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{CXO}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} by {\textasciitilde} 10\% in both cases. Our results are limited by uncertainties in the geometry of the cluster gas, contamination from kinetic {SZ} ({\textasciitilde}10\%), and the absolute calibration of the {tSZ} map (7\%).

	abstract = {Measurement of the gas velocity distribution in galaxy clusters provides insight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form in the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium ({ICM}) can be obtained via the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({SZ}) effect, but its observation is challenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic effects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report resolved observations, at 150 and 260 {GHz}, of the {SZ} effect toward the triple merger {MACS} J0717.5+3745 ({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.55), using data obtained with the {NIKA} camera at the {IRAM} 30 m telescope. Assuming that {theSZ} signal is the sum of a thermal ({tSZ}) and a kinetic ({kSZ}) component and by combining the two {NIKA} bands, we extract for the first time a resolved map of the {kSZ} signal in a cluster. The {kSZ} signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at −5.1 and + 3.4{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us and coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a major merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight velocity of {MACS} J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining {NIKA} data with X-ray observations from {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton {\textless}i/{\textgreater}and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, we fit this model to constrain the gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the first time, a velocity map from {kSZ} data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our results are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and thanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the structure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination and systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter galaxies. Among the sources that we detect with {NIKA}, we find one which is likely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.},

	abstract = {The prototype of the {NIKA}2 camera, {NIKA}, is a dual-band instrument operating at the {IRAM} 30-m telescope, which can observe the sky simultaneously at 150 and 260 {GHz}. One of the main goals of {NIKA} (and {NIKA}2) is to measure the pressure distribution in galaxy clusters at high angular resolution using the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({tSZ}) effect. Such observations have already proved to be an excellent probe of cluster pressure distributions even at intermediate and high redshifts. However, an important fraction of clusters host sub-millimeter and/or radio point sources, which can significantly affect the reconstructed signal. Here we report on {\textless}20 arcsec angular resolution observations at 150 and 260 {GHz} of the cluster {MACS} J1423.8+2404, which hosts both radio and sub-millimeter point sources. We examine the morphological distribution of the {tSZ} signal and compare it to other datasets. The {NIKA} data are combined with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel {\textless}i/{\textgreater}satellite data to study the spectral energy distribution ({SED}) of the sub-millimeter point source contaminants. We then perform a joint reconstruction of the intracluster medium ({ICM}) electronic pressure and density by combining {NIKA}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data, focusing on the impact of the radio and sub-millimeter sources on the reconstructed pressureprofile. We find that large-scale pressure distribution is unaffected by the point sources because of the resolved nature of the {NIKA} observations. The reconstructed pressure in the inner region is slightly higher when the contribution of point sources are removed. We show that it is not possible to set strong constraints on the central pressure distribution without accurately removing these contaminants. The comparison with X-ray only data shows good agreement for the pressure, temperature, and entropy profiles, which all indicate that {MACS} J1423.8+2404 is a dynamically relaxed cool core system. The present observations illustrate the possibility of measuring these quantities with a relatively small integration time, even at high redshift and without X-ray spectroscopy. This work is part of a pilot study aiming at optimizing {tSZ} observations with the future {NIKA}2 camera.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Millimetre-wave continuum astronomy is today an indispensable tool for both general astrophysics studies (e.g. star formation, nearby galaxies) and cosmology (e.g. cosmic microwave background and high-redshift galaxies). General purpose, large-field-of-view instruments are needed to map the sky at intermediate angular scales not accessible by the high-resolution interferometers (e.g. {ALMA} in Chile, {NOEMA} in the French Alps) and by the coarse angular resolution space-borne or ground-based surveys (e.g. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {ACT}, {SPT}). These instruments have to be installed at the focal plane of the largest single-dish telescopes, which are placed at high altitude on selected dry observing sites. In this context, we have constructed and deployed a three-thousand-pixel dual-band (150 {GHz} and 260 {GHz}, respectively 2 mm and 1.15 mm wavelengths) camera to image an instantaneous circular field-of-view of 6.5 arcmin in diameter, and configurable to map the linear polarisation at 260 {GHz}.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}First, we are providing a detailed description of this instrument, named {NIKA}2 (New {IRAM} {KID} Arrays 2), in particular focussing on the cryogenics, optics, focal plane arrays based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors, and the readout electronics. The focal planes and part of the optics are cooled down to the nominal 150 {mK} operating temperature by means of an adhoc dilution refrigerator. Secondly, we are presenting the performance measured on the sky during the commissioning runs that took place between October 2015 and April 2017 at the 30-m {IRAM} telescope at Pico Veleta, near Granada (Spain).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We have targeted a number of astronomical sources. Starting from beam-maps on primary and secondary calibrators we have then gone to extended sources and faint objects. Both internal (electronic) and on-the-sky calibrations are applied. The general methods are described in the present paper.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}{NIKA}2 has been successfully deployed and commissioned, performing in-line with expectations. In particular, {NIKA}2 exhibits full width at half maximum angular resolutions of around 11 and 17.5 arcsec at respectively 260 and 150 {GHz}. The noise equivalent flux densities are, at these two respective frequencies, 33±2 and 8±1 {mJy} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. A first successful science verification run was achieved in April 2017. The instrument is currently offered to the astronomy community and will remain available for at least the following ten years.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy 
clustering and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg2 of
griz imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}
Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear
correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift
bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000
luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear
cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy
shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use
independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric-redshift estimation and
validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation
bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while "blind" to the true
results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed
and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat
Λ {CDM} and w {CDM} cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance
parameters, varying 6 (for Λ {CDM} ) or 7 (for w {CDM} ) cosmological
parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457
×457 element analytic covariance matrix. We find consistent
cosmological results from these three two-point functions and from their
combination obtain
S8≡σ8(Ωm/0.3
)0.5=0.77 3-0.020+0.026 and
Ωm=0.26 7-0.017+0.030 for
Λ {CDM} ; for w {CDM} , we find S8=0.78
2-0.024+0.036, Ωm=0.28
4-0.030+0.033, and w =-0.8
2-0.20+0.21 at 68\% C.L. The precision of these {DES}
Y1 constraints rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background
measurements, allowing a comparison of structure in the very early and
late Universe on equal terms. Although the {DES} Y1 best-fit values for
S8 and Ωm are lower than the central values
from Planck for both Λ {CDM} and w {CDM} , the Bayes factor indicates
that the {DES} Y1 and Planck data sets are consistent with each other in
the context of Λ {CDM} . Combining {DES} Y1 with Planck, baryonic
acoustic oscillation measurements from {SDSS}, 6dF, and {BOSS} and type Ia
supernovae from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis data set, we derive very
tight constraints on cosmological parameters: S8=0.802
±0.012 and Ωm=0.298 ±0.007 in Λ
{CDM} and w =-1.0 0-0.04+0.05 in w {CDM} . Upcoming
Dark Energy Survey analyses will provide more stringent tests of the
Λ {CDM} model and extensions such as a time-varying equation of
state of dark energy or modified gravity.},

As demonstrated by Planck, galaxy clusters detected via the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich ({SZ}) effect offer a powerful way to constrain cosmological parameters such as Ωm and σ8. Determining the absolute cluster mass scale is, however, difficult, and some recent calibrations have yielded cosmological constraints in apparent tension with constraints in the Λ{CDM} model derived from the power spectra of the primary {CMB} anisotropies. In order to calibrate the absolute mass scale of the full Planck cluster sample, we remeasure the masses of all 433 clusters through their weak lensing signature in the {CMB} temperature anisotropies as measured by Planck. We perform a joint Bayesian analysis of the cluster counts and masses taking as input the estimated cluster masses, {SZ} signal-to-noise ratios, and redshifts. Our analysis properly accounts for selection effects in the construction of the cluster sample. We find σ8(Ωm/0.33)0.25 = 0.765 ± 0.035 and \$1-b\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{{SZ}\}\} = 0.71 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10\$, where the mass bias factor \$1-b\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{{SZ}\}\}\$ relates cluster mass to the {SZ} mass that appears in the X-ray-calibrated cluster scaling relations. We find no evidence for tension with the Planck primary {CMB} constraints on Λ{CDM} model parameters.},

	abstract = {Matched filters are routinely used in cosmology in order to detect galaxy clusters from mm observations through their thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({tSZ}) signature. In addition, they naturally provide an observable, the detection signal-to-noise or significance, which can be used as a mass proxy in number counts analyses of {tSZ}-selected cluster samples. In this work, we show that this observable is, in general, non-Gaussian, and that it suffers from a positive bias, which we refer to as optimisation bias. Both aspects arise from the fact that the signal-to-noise is constructed through an optimisation operation on noisy data, and hold even if the cluster signal is modelled perfectly well, no foregrounds are present, and the noise is Gaussian. After reviewing the general mathematical formalism underlying matched filters, we study the statistics of the signal-to-noise with a set Monte Carlo mock observations, finding it to be well-described by a unit-variance Gaussian for signal-to-noise values of 6 and above, and quantify the magnitude of the optimisation bias, for which we give an approximate expression that may be used in practice. We also consider the impact of the bias on the cluster number counts of Planck and the Simons
Observatory ({SO}), finding it to be negligible for the former and potentially significant for the latter.},

	abstract = {We present a set of cluster models that link the present-day properties of clusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation. These models treat the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamental property. Because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient that rises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster depend entirely on its dark matter potential and the entropy distribution of its uncondensed gas. Guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropy distribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernova heating by assuming that the gas density distribution would be identical to that of the dark matter. The lowest entropy gas would then fall below a critical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a Hubble time. Radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify the entropy of that
low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distribution function and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. Using some phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on the existence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set of cluster models. The surface brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, and luminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge from these models. By introducing a single adjustable parameter related to the amount of intracluster gas that can cool within a Hubble time, we can also reproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations of cooling flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.},

other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six
gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses
except the first are analysed blindly with respect to the cosmological
parameters. In a flat Λ cold dark matter (Λ{CDM}) cosmology,
we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ , a
\$2.4\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ precision measurement, in agreement with local
measurements of H0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the
distance ladder, but in 3.1σ tension with Planck observations of
the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}). This method is completely
independent of both the supernovae and {CMB} analyses. A combination of
time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3σ
tension with Planck {CMB} determinations of H0 in flat
Λ{CDM}. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give
statistically consistent results, showing that we are not
underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our
systematics. We explore extensions to flat Λ{CDM} using constraints
from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other
cosmological probes, including {CMB} observations from Planck, baryon
acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography
improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong
complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the
tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay
cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce
the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model
assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined
inference on H0 ranges from ∼73 to 78 km
s‑1 Mpc‑1, which is consistent with
the local distance ladder constraints.},

In this paper we study the properties of the six optically dark galaxies detected in the 69 arcmin{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {GOODS}-{ALMA} 1.1 mm continuum survey. While none of them are listed in the deepest {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band based {CANDELS} catalog in the {GOODS}-South field down to {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 28.16 {AB}, we were able to de-blend two of them from their bright neighbor and measure an {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band flux for them. We present the spectroscopic scan follow-up of five of the six sources with {ALMA} band 4. All are detected in the 2 mm continuum with signal-to-noise ratios higher than eight. One emission line is detected in {AGS}4 ({\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}obs{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 151.44 {GHz} with an {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 8.58) and {AGS}17 ({\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}obs{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 154.78 {GHz} with an {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 10.23), which we interpret in both cases as being due to the {CO}(6–5) line at = 3.556 and = 3.467, respectively. These redshifts match both the probability distribution of the photometric redshifts derived from the {UV} to near-infrared spectral energy distributions ({SEDs}) and the far-infrared {SEDs} for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these redshifts. We present evidence that nearly 70\% (4/6 of galaxies) of the optically dark galaxies belong to the same overdensity of galaxies at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ∼ 3.5. overdensity The most massive one, {AGS}24 ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 10 ), is the most massive galaxy without an active galactic nucleus at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 3 in the {GOODS}-{ALMA} field. It falls in the very center of the peak of the galaxy surface density, which suggests that the surrounding overdensity is a proto-cluster in the process of virialization and that {AGS}24 is the candidate progenitor of the future brightest cluster galaxy.},

	abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical
properties, or that Einstein’s theory of gravity breaks down on
cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with
experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations ({BAO}), weak
gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage {IV}” dark energy facilities such as {BigBOSS}, {LSST},
Euclid, and {WFIRST}. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage {III} and Stage {IV} experimental programs that incorporate
supernovae, {BAO}, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial
programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary
information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

	abstract = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 1014 1015 M⊙ , and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing
important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially “closed boxes” that retain all their gaseous
matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of
clusters, providing a context for interpreting the flood of new cluster observations that are now arriving from the latest generation of x-ray observatories, large optical surveys, and measurements of
cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.},

Lynx will see the dawn of black holes, reveal what drives galaxy formation and evolution, and unveil the energetic side of stellar evolution and stellar ecosystems. Lynx science payload will enables radical advances and leaps in capability over {NASA}'s existing flagship Chandra and the {ESA}'s planned Athena mission: 100-fold increase in sensitivity via coupling superb angular resolution with high throughput; 16 times larger field of view ({FOV}) for sub-arcsecond imaging; and 10-20 times higher spectral resolution for both point-like and extended sources. The Lynx Design Reference Mission has been designed to meet the science objectives of the future while capitalizing where appropriate on decades of experience, and especially from efficient, flight-proven approaches, design choices, and mission operations software and procedures developed for Chandra. While the science program outlined for Lynx in this report is already very broad, the observatory is designed such that there will be ample resources to execute many other programs, even those not anticipated today. Virtually all astronomers will be able to use Lynx for their own particular science.},

This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

	abstract = {Parametric modeling of galaxy cluster density profiles from weak lensing observations leads to a mass bias, whose detailed understanding is critical in deriving accurate mass-observable relations for constraining cosmological models. Drawing from existing methods, we develop a robust framework for calculating this mass bias in one-parameter fits to simulations of dark matter halos. We show that our approach has the advantage of being independent of the absolute noise level, so that only the number of halos in a given simulation and the representativeness of the simulated halos for real clusters limit the accuracy of the bias estimation. While we model the bias as a log-normal distribution and the halos with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our method can be generalized to any bias distribution and parametric model of the radial mass distribution. We find that the log-normal assumption is not strictly valid in the presence of miscentring of halos. We investigate the use of cluster centers derived from weak lensing in the context of mass bias, and tentatively find that such centroids can yield sensible mass estimates if the convergence peak has a signal-to-noise ratio
approximately greater than four. In this context we also find that the standard approach to estimating the positional uncertainty of weak lensing mass peaks using bootstrapping severely underestimates the true positional uncertainty for peaks with low signal-to-noise ratios. Though we determine the mass and redshift dependence of the bias distribution for a few experimental setups, our focus remains providing a general approach to computing such distributions.},

	abstract = {This thesis introduces a set of methods for testing models of modified gravity using galaxy clusters. In particular, a technique for
constraining models with a chameleon screening is introduced. In addition, the outlined technique is expanded to test a wider class of models, such as the theory of emergent gravity. Finally, the first part of the thesis is concluded by adapting the mentioned tests for model independent constraints. The obtained results indicate that galaxy clusters can be used to obtain some of the most powerful constraints on cosmological scales. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the topic of cosmological emulators. More specifically, a technique of emulating cosmological N-body simulation output data based on machine learning is introduced. Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are used to emulate dark matter-only as well as hydrodynamical simulation data. In addition, N-body modified gravity simulations are explored as well. The presented investigation of the {GAN} algorithm shows that such emulators offer a powerful, fast and efficient way of producing
simulation output data with different cosmological parameters. The power spectrum analysis indicates a 1-20\% difference between the training and the generated data depending on the dataset used and whether Gaussian smoothing is applied or not.},

times to the high redshift epoch of reionisation is essential to
constraining the cosmology, the history of star formation and

better understanding of the physical process that drive galaxy formation
and evolution. Using the integrated emission from unresolved galaxies or
gas clouds, line intensity mapping ({LIM}) provides a new observational
window to measure the larger properties of structure. This very
promising technique motivates the community to plan for {LIM} experiments.
We describe the development of a large field-of-view instrument, named
{CONCERTO}, operating in the range 130-310 {GHz} from the {APEX} 12-meters
telescope. {CONCERTO} is a low-resolution spectrometer based on the Lumped
Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors technology. Spectra are obtained
using a fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer ({FTS}), coupled to a dilution
cryostat with base temperature of 0.1K. Two 2 kilo-pixels arrays of
{LEKID} are mounted inside the cryostat that also contains the cold optics
and the front-end electronics. We present in detail the technological
choices leading to the instrumental concept, together with the design
and fabrication of the instrument and preliminary laboratory tests on
the detectors. We also give our best estimates of {CONCERTO} sensitivity
and give predictions for two of the main scientific goals of {CONCERTO},
i.e. a [{CII}]-intensity mapping survey and observations of galaxy
clusters. We provide a detail description of the instrument design.
Based on realistic comparisons with existing instruments developed by
our group ({NIKA}, {NIKA}2, and {KISS}), and on laboratory detectors
characterisation, we provide an estimate of {CONCERTO} sensitivity on sky.
Finally, we describe in detail two out of the main science goals offered
by {CONCERTO} at {APEX}.},

An accurate characterization of the shape, intrinsic scatter, and redshift evolution of this profile is necessary to estimate some of the biases and systematic effects that currently prevent cosmological analyses based on thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({tSZ}) surveys from obtaining precise and unbiased cosmological constraints. This is one of the main goals of the ongoing {NIKA}2 {SZ} large program, which aims at mapping the {tSZ} signal of a representative cluster sample selected from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {ACT} catalogs and spans a redshift range 0.5 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.9.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. To estimate the impact of intracluster medium ({ICM}) disturbances that can be detected by {NIKA}2 on the mean pressure profile of galaxy clusters, we realized a study based on a synthetic cluster sample that is similar to that of the {NIKA}2 {SZ} large program.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. To reach this goal we employed the hydrodynamical N-body simulation Marenostrum {MUltidark} {SImulations} of galaxy Clusters ({MUSIC}). We simulated realistic {NIKA}2 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {tSZ} observations, which were jointly analyzed to estimate the {ICM} pressure profile of each cluster. A comparison of the deprojected profiles with the true radial profiles directly extracted from the {MUSIC} simulation allowed us to validate the {NIKA}2 {tSZ} pipeline and to study the impact of {ICM} disturbances on the characterization of the {ICM} pressure distribution even at high redshift. After normalizing each profile by the integrated quantities estimated under the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis, we evaluated the mean pressure profile of the twin sample and show that it is compatible with that extracted directly from the {MUSIC} simulation in the scale range that can be recovered by {NIKA}2. We studied the impact of cluster dynamical state on both its shape and associated scatter.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are a recent cosmological probe. The precision and accuracy of the cosmological parameters inferred from these objects are affected by the knowledge of cluster physics, entering the analysis through the mass-observable scaling relations, and the theoretical description of their mass and redshift distribution, modelled by the mass function. In this work we forecast the impact of different modelling of these ingredients for clusters detected by future optical and near-{IR} surveys. We consider the standard cosmological scenario and the case with a time-dependent equation of state for dark energy. We analyse the effect of increasing precision on the scaling relation calibration, finding improved constraints on the cosmological parameters. This higher precision exposes the impact of the mass function evaluation, which is a subdominant source of systematics for current data. We compare two different evaluations for the mass function. In both cosmological scenarios the use of different mass functions leads to biases in the parameter constraints. For the Λ{CDM} model, we find a 1.6σ shift in the (Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}8{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}) parameter plane and a discrepancy of ∼7σ for the redshift evolution of the scatter of the scaling relations. For the scenario with a time-evolving dark energy equation of state, the assumption of different mass functions results in a ∼8σ tension in the w{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} parameter. These results show the impact, and the necessity for a precise modelling, of the interplay between the redshift evolution of the mass function and of the scaling relations in the cosmological analysis of galaxy clusters.},

In this paper we use the same method of analysis already adopted in the Euclid Red Book, which is based on the Fisher matrix approach. Based on our analytical estimate of the cluster selection function in the photometric Euclid survey, we forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters
corresponding to different extensions of the standard Λ cold dark matter model. Using only Euclid clusters, we find that the amplitude of the matter power spectrum will be constrained to
Δσ8 = 0.0014 and the mass density parameter to
ΔΩm = 0.0011. The dynamical evolution of dark
energy will be constrained to Δw0 = 0.03 and
Δwa = 0.2 with free curvature Ωk,
resulting in a (w0, wa) figure of merit ({FoM}) of 291. In combination with Planck cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) constraints, the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity will be constrained to Δ{fNL} ≃ 6.6 for the local shape
scenario. The growth factor parameter γ, which signals deviations from general relativity, will be constrained to Δγ = 0.02,
and the neutrino density parameter to ΔΩν =
0.0013 (or Δ∑mν = 0.01). Including the Planck
{CMB} covariance matrix improves dark energy constraints to
Δw0 = 0.02, Δwa = 0.07, and a {FoM} =
802. Knowledge of the observable-cluster mass scaling relation is crucial to reach these accuracies. Imaging and spectroscopic
capabilities of Euclid will enable internal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of cluster galaxies, supported by external cluster surveys.},

The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in ∼500 {CPU} hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the {redMaPPer} algorithm to ∼10, 000 deg2 of {SDSS} {DR}8 data and present the resulting catalog of ∼25,000 clusters over the redshift range z ∈ [0.08, 0.55]. The {redMaPPer} photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter σz ≈ 0.006 at z ≈ 0.1, increasing to σz ≈ 0.02 at z ≈ 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for {\textbar}Δz{\textbar}/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low (⩽5\%).

Pole Telescope ({SPT}) {SZ} observations targeting the first sample of
galaxy clusters at \$0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3\$, selected to be the progenitors
of well-studied nearby clusters based on their expected accretion rate.
We develop a new procedure in order to tackle the analysis challenge
that is estimating the intracluster medium ({ICM}) properties of low-mass
and high-redshift clusters with \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}150\$ X-ray counts. One of the
dominant sources of uncertainty on the {ICM} density profile estimated
with a standard X-ray analysis with such shallow X-ray data is due to
the systematic uncertainty associated with the {ICM} temperature obtained
through the analysis of the background-dominated X-ray spectrum. We show
that we can decrease the uncertainty on the density profile by a factor
\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}5\$ with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness
profile measured by \$Chandra\$ and the {SZ} integrated Compton parameter
available in the {SPT} cluster catalog. We apply this technique to the
whole sample of 67 clusters in order to track the evolution of the {ICM}
core density during cluster growth. We confirm that the evolution of the
gas density profile is well modeled by the combination of a fixed core
and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core profile. We show that the
fraction of cool-cores in this sample is remarkably stable with redshift
although clusters have gained a factor \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}4\$ in total mass over the
past \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}9\$ Gyr. This new sample combined with our new X-ray/{SZ}
analysis procedure and extensive multi-wavelength data will allow us to
address fundamental shortcomings in our current understanding of cluster
formation and evolution at \$z {\textgreater} 1\$.},

We present the results of a multiwavelength analysis of the very massive cluster {MOO} J1142+1527 at a redshift z = 1.2 discovered as part of the Massive and Distant Clusters of {WISE} Survey. This analysis is based on high angular resolution Chandra X-ray and {NIKA}2 Sunyaev–Zel’dovich ({SZ}) data. The cluster thermodynamic radial profiles have been obtained with unprecedented precision at this redshift and up to 0.7R 500, thanks to the combination of high-resolution X-ray and {SZ} data. The comparison between the galaxy distribution mapped in infrared by Spitzer and the morphological properties of the {ICM} derived from the combined analysis of the Chandra and {NIKA}2 data leads us to the conclusion that the cluster is an ongoing merger. We have estimated a systematic uncertainty on the cluster total mass that characterizes both the impact of the observed deviations from spherical symmetry and of the core dynamics on the mass profile. We further combine the X-ray and {SZ} data at the pixel level to obtain maps of the temperature and entropy distributions. We find a relatively low-entropy core at the position of the X-ray peak and high-temperature regions located on its south and west sides. This work demonstrates that the addition of spatially resolved {SZ} observations to low signal-to-noise X-ray data brings a high information gain on the characterization of the evolution of {ICM} thermodynamic properties at z {\textgreater} 1.},

We have analysed the effects of a mass-redshift dependence, adopting a power-law parametrisation. We applied this parametrisation to the combination of {tSZ} number counts and power spectrum, finding a hint of redshift dependence that leads to a decreasing value of the mass bias for higher redshift. We tested the robustness of our results for different mass bias calibrations and a discrete redshift dependence. We find our results to be dependent on the clusters sample that we are considering, in particular obtaining an inverse (decreasing) redshift dependence when neglecting {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.2 clusters. We analysed the effects of this parametrisation on the combination of cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) primary anisotropies and {tSZ} galaxy clusters.

The corresponding value of {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is too high with respect to weak lensing and numerical simulations estimations.

It is essential to constrain a potential redshift evolution of both the slope and scatter of the mass-observable scaling relations used in cosmology studies based on cluster statistics. In this paper, we present the first thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich ({tSZ}) mapping of a cluster from the sample of the New {IRAM} Kids Arrays ({NIKA}2) {SZ} large program that aims at constraining the redshift evolution of cluster pressure profiles and the {tSZ}-mass scaling relation. We observed the galaxy cluster {PSZ}2 G144.83+25.11 at redshift {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.58 with the {NIKA}2 camera, a dual-band (150 and 260 {GHz}) instrument operated at the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimtrique ({IRAM}) 30-m telescope. We identify a thermal pressure excess in the south-west region of {PSZ}2 G144.83+25.11 and a high-redshift sub-millimeter point source that affect the intracluster medium ({ICM}) morphology of the cluster. The {NIKA}2 data are used jointly with {tSZ} data acquired by the Multiplexed {SQUID}/{TES} Array at Ninety Gigahertz ({MUSTANG}), Bolocam, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} experiments in order to non-parametrically set the best constraints on the electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.02{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) to its outskirts ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 3{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). We investigate the impact of the over-pressure region on the shape of the pressure profile and on the constraints on the integrated Compton parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. A hydrostatic mass analysis is also performed by combining the {tSZ}-constrained pressure profile with the deprojected electronic density profile from {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-{\textless}i{\textgreater}Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.

We find that in the Λ{CDM} model, the addition of a {tSZ} power spectrum provides small improvements with respect to number counts alone, leading to the 68\% c.l. constraints Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.32 ± 0.02, {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.76 ± 0.03, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}(Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/0.3){\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} = 0.78 ± 0.03 and lowering the discrepancy with results for cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) primary anisotropies (updated with the new value of {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) to ≃1.8{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} on {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We analysed extensions to the standard model, considering the effect of massive neutrinos and varying the equation of state parameter for dark energy. In the first case, we find that the addition of the {tSZ} power spectrum helps in improving cosmological constraints with respect to number count alone results, leading to the 95\% upper limit ∑ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 1.88 {eV}. For the varying dark energy equation of state scenario, we find no important improvements when adding {tSZ} power spectrum, but still the combination of {tSZ} probes is able to provide constraints, producing {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = −1.0 ± 0.2. In all cosmological scenarios, the mass bias to reconcile {CMB} and {tSZ} probes remains low at (1 − {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) ≲ 0.67 as compared to estimates from weak lensing and X-ray mass estimate comparisons or numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {La distribution de masse dans l'Univers telle que tracée par les amas de galaxies constitue une sonde cosmologique puissante. La caractérisation des processus associés à l'origine et à la croissance des grandes structures permet de contraindre des paramètres cosmologiques via l'étude de la distribution des amas en fonction de leur masse et de leur redshift. Cependant, il existe un désaccord statistiquement significatif observé entre les contraintes cosmologiques établies par l'étude des anisotropies primaires du fond diffus cosmologique et celles issues de l'analyse de la distribution des amas de galaxies. Cela pourrait signifier que le modèle standard de la cosmologie est incomplet. L'une des méthodes d'observation des amas de galaxie exploite l'effet Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}) qui permet de contraindre la pression du gaz contenu dans ces derniers. Cette observable peut être directement liée à la masse des amas via une relation d'échelle et un profil de pression. Il est donc essentiel de caractériser précisément ces derniers afin de limiter les potentiels biais et effets systématiques affectant les analyses cosmologiques. Cette thèse présente l'ensemble des travaux réalisés dans cet objectif. Elle porte sur des thématiques allant des observations {SZ} effectuées avec la caméra {NIKA}2 installée au télescope de 30 mètres de l’{IRAM} jusqu'à l'estimation des paramètres cosmologiques en passant par l'analyse des données brutes de {NIKA}2 et des cartes {SZ} réalisées.Une part du travail de thèse présenté dans ce document est consacrée à l'étude et l’amélioration des différentes étapes effectuées, depuis les observations d'amas de galaxies au télescope avec la caméra {NIKA}2 jusqu'à la production de cartes de l'effet {SZ}. Les procédures développées pour estimer les performances instrumentales de {NIKA}2 sont détaillées et la chaîne d'analyse utilisée pour réduire les données brutes est présentée.Les travaux réalisés dans cette thèse ont également consisté à caractériser les propriétés thermodynamiques d'amas de galaxies via des analyses jointes combinant les cartes {SZ} {NIKA}2 avec des données X mesurées par le satellite {XMM}-Newton. Nous détaillons les méthodes employées dans le logiciel de traitement des données {SZ} créé pour le grand programme {SZ} de {NIKA}2, la procédure de déprojection non-paramétrique développée pour caractériser le profil de pression des amas de galaxies et les résultats de la première observation {SZ} avec {NIKA}2.Les dernières activités présentées sont dédiées aux analyses réalisées afin de quantifier l'impact du grand programme {SZ} de {NIKA}2 sur la cosmologie. Nous analysons l'effet des perturbations dynamiques du milieu intra-amas sur la caractérisation du profil de pression avec {NIKA}2 via l'utilisation d'amas de la simulation numérique {MUSIC}.

	abstract = {The determination of the thermodynamic properties of clusters of galaxies at intermediate and high redshift can bring new insights into the formation of large-scale structures. It is essential for a robust calibration of the mass-observable scaling relations and their scatter, which are key ingredients for precise cosmology using cluster statistics. Here we illustrate an application of high resolution ({\textless}20 arcsec) thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({tSZ}) observations by probing the intracluster medium ({ICM}) of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-discovered galaxy cluster {PSZ}1 G045.85+57.71 at redshift {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.61, using {tSZ} data obtained with the {NIKA} camera, which is a dual-band (150 and 260 {GHz}) instrument operated at the {IRAM} 30-m telescope. We deproject jointly {NIKA} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data to extract the electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.02 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) to its outskirts ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 3 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) non-parametrically for the first time at intermediate redshift. The constraints on the resulting pressure profile allow us to reduce the relative uncertainty on the integrated Compton parameter by a factor of two compared to the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} value. Combining the {tSZ} data and the deprojected electronic density profile from {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} allows us to undertake a hydrostatic mass analysis, for which we study the impact of a spherical model assumption on the total mass estimate. We also investigate the radial temperature and entropy distributions. These data indicate that {PSZ}1 G045.85+57.71 is a massive ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 5.5 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) cool-core cluster. This work is part of a pilot study aiming at optimizing the treatment of the {NIKA}2 {tSZ} large program dedicated to the follow-up of {SZ}-discovered clusters at intermediate and high redshifts. This study illustrates the potential of {NIKA}2 to put constraints on thethermodynamic properties and {tSZ}-scaling relations of these clusters, and demonstrates the excellent synergy between {tSZ} and X-ray observations of similar angular resolution.},

	abstract = {High-mass clusters at low redshifts have been intensively studied at 
various wavelengths. However, while more distant objects at lower masses
constitute the bulk population of future surveys, their physical state
remain poorly explored to date. In this paper, we present resolved
observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ({SZ}) effect, obtained with the
{NIKA}2 camera, towards the cluster of galaxies {XLSSC} 102, a relatively
low-mass system (M500 ∼ 2 × 1014
M⊙) at z = 0.97 detected from the {XXL} survey. We combine
{NIKA}2 {SZ} data, {XMM}-Newton X-ray data, and Megacam optical data to
explore, respectively, the spatial distribution of the gas electron
pressure, the gas density, and the galaxies themselves. We find
significant offsets between the X-ray peak, the {SZ} peak, the brightest
cluster galaxy, and the peak of galaxy density. Additionally, the galaxy
distribution and the gas present elongated morphologies. This is
interpreted as the sign of a recent major merging event, which induced a
local boost of the gas pressure towards the north of {XLSSC} 102 and
stripped the gas out of the galaxy group. The {NIKA}2 data are also
combined with {XXL} data to construct the thermodynamic profiles of {XLSSC}
102, obtaining relatively tight constraints up to about
∼r500, and revealing properties that are typical of
disturbed systems. We also explore the impact of the cluster centre
definition and the implication of local pressure substructure on the
recovered profiles. Finally, we derive the global properties of {XLSSC}
102 and compare them to those of high-mass-and-low-redshift systems,
finding no strong evidence for non-standard evolution. We also use
scaling relations to obtain alternative mass estimates from our
profiles. The variation between these different mass estimates reflects
the difficulty to accurately measure the mass of low-mass clusters at z
∼ 1, especially with low signal-to-noise ratio data and for a
disturbed system. However, it also highlights the strength of resolved
{SZ} observations alone and in combination with survey-like X-ray data.
This is promising for the study of high redshift clusters from the
combination of {eROSITA} and high resolution {SZ} instruments and will
complement the new generation of optical surveys from facilities such as
{LSST} and Euclid.

	abstract = {Lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors({LEKIDs}) have recently shown considerable promise as direct absorption mm-wavelength detectors for astronomical applications. One major research thrust within the
Néel Iram Kids Array ({NIKA}) collaboration has been to investigate the suitability of these detectors for deployment at the 30-meter {IRAM} telescope located on Pico Veleta in Spain. Compared to microwave kinetic inductance detectors ({MKID}), using quarter wavelength resonators, the resonant circuit of a {LEKID} consists of a discrete inductance and capacitance coupled to a feedline. A high and constant current density distribution in the inductive part of these resonators makes them very sensitive. Due to only one metal layer on a silicon substrate, the fabrication is relatively easy. In order to optimize the {LEKIDs} for this application, we have recently probed a wide variety of individual resonator and array parameters through simulation and physical testing. This included determining the optimal feed-line coupling, pixel
geometry, resonator distribution within an array (in order to minimize pixel cross-talk), and resonator frequency spacing. Based on these results, a 144-pixel Aluminum array was fabricated and tested in a dilution fridge with optical access, yielding an average optical {NEP} of {\textasciitilde}2E-16 W/Hz{\textasciicircum}1/2 (best pixels showed {NEP} = 6E-17 W/Hz{\textasciicircum}1/2 under 4-8 {pW} loading per pixel). In October 2010 the second prototype of {LEKIDs} has been tested at the {IRAM} 30 m telescope. A new {LEKID} geometry for 2 polarizations will be presented. Also first optical measurements of a titanium nitride array will be discussed.},

of {SNe} Ia. Gyroscopic control of {HST} was employed to reduce overheads
while collecting a large sample of widely separated Cepheids. The
Cepheid period-luminosity relation provides a
zero-point-independent link with 0.4\% precision between the new 1.2\%
geometric distance to the {LMC} from detached eclipsing binaries ({DEBs})
measured by Pietrzyński et al. and the luminosity of {SNe} Ia.
Measurements and analysis of the {LMC} Cepheids were completed prior to
knowledge of the new {DEB} {LMC} distance. Combined with a refined
calibration of the count-rate linearity of {WFC}3-{IR} with 0.1\% precision,
these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in
the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the
{LMC} from 2.5\% to 1.3\%. Using only the {LMC} {DEBs} to calibrate the ladder,
we find H 0 = 74.22 ± 1.82 km s-1

	abstract = {Addressing fundamental questions regarding our understanding of the Universe, such as the cause of its accelerated expansion or the nature of dark matter, requires to confront theories and observations. In this context, galaxy clusters can be used as powerful observational probes. However, their current utilisation is limited by uncertainties and systematic effects, notably affecting the measurement of their mass, which is presumably dominated by dark matter.Galaxy clusters can be studied at different wavelengths: the hot gas composing the Intra Cluster Medium ({ICM}) shines in X-ray and is observable at millimetre wavelengths via the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({SZ}) effect, whereas galaxies emit principally in the optical and infrared. Combining and comparing these observables allows us to reduce the uncertainties and systematics in the cosmological constraints obtained from clusters. In this context, this thesis aims at paving the way of future large surveys such as Euclid and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. It presents the multi-wavelengths analyses of a sample of clusters detected in X-ray in the {XXL} survey, spanning a wide range of masses and redshifts. The first part of the thesis introduces the cosmological context and presents the observational properties of galaxies and clusters, and the ingredients to build cosmological cluster samples. The second part concentrates on the optical characterisation of {XXL} clusters and the properties of their member galaxies. It starts by presenting {XXL} and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey ({CFHTLS}), an optical counterpart survey. Then, it focuses on the characterisation of the {CFHTLS} photometric redshifts quality and their use to construct the optical galaxy luminosity functions ({LF}) of {XXL} clusters. The {LF} of satellite galaxies is found to slightly depend on cluster richness, the main optical mass proxy, but no significant redshift evolution is observed. Then, the study of the colour and active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) fraction in {XXL} cluster galaxies is performed, finding that the mass plays a key role in shaping {AGN} and star formation activity in clusters. Finally, the {WaZP} optical cluster finder algorithm is used to investigate the optical counterparts of {XXL} clusters. The third part of this thesis is dedicated to the observational project dedicated to the mapping of the {SZ} signal in three distant {XXL} clusters, with the high angular resolution {NIKA}2 camera. The preparation of the project is discussed, making use of the X-ray and optical data to predict the expected {SZ} signal. Then, the observation procedure at the telescope and the data reduction, dedicated to produce calibrated {SZ} maps, are presented. The project is still ongoing and one cluster, {XLSSC}102, at z = 0.97, has been partially observed. The development of the blind detection of galaxies potentially contaminating the {SZ} signal is developed, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of dusty star forming galaxies in the field of {XLSSC}102. The morphology and dynamical state of {XLSSC}102 are then characterised using optical, {SZ} and X-ray data and the radial {ICM} thermodynamics and mass profiles are measured combining {SZ} and X-ray data. This allows us to show that {XLSSC}102 is a merging cluster with a mass ∼ 3 × 10 14 M, and is compatible with the standard evolution scenario of cluster formation.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich ({tSZ}) effect have long been recognized as a powerful cosmological probe. Here we assess the importance of relativistic temperature corrections to the {tSZ} signal on the power spectrum analysis of the Planck Compton-y map, developing a novel formalism to account for the associated effects. The amplitude of the {tSZ} power spectrum is found to be sensitive to the effective electron temperature, \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\}\$, of the cluster sample. Omitting the corresponding modifications leads to an underestimation of the yypower spectrum amplitude. Relativistic corrections thus add to the error budget of {tSZ} power spectrum observables such as σ8. This could help alleviate the tension between various cosmological probes, with the correction scaling as \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}sigma \_8/{\textbackslash}sigma \_8 {\textbackslash}simeq 0.019{\textbackslash}, [k\{{\textbackslash}bar\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\}/5{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm {keV}\}]\$ for Planck. At the current level of precision, this implies a systematic shift by ≃ 1σ, which can also be interpreted as an overestimation of the hydrostatic mass bias by \${\textbackslash}Delta b {\textbackslash}simeq 0.046{\textbackslash}, (1-b){\textbackslash}, [k\{{\textbackslash}bar\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\}/5{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm {keV}\}]\$, bringing it into better agreement with hydrodynamical simulations.

	abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia 
supernovae ({SNe} Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 0.62. The
luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that
employ relations between {SN} Ia luminosity and light curve shape.
Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and
recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift
supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant
(i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration
parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The
distances of the high-redshift {SNe} Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther
than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a
cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, {SN} Ia
subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding
models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0)
and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no
prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater}= 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed {SNe} Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0
{\textless} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the
two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the
spectroscopically confirmed {SNe} Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at 7
sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different
fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M =
1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the
universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in
the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and
metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local
perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample
contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the
data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {\textgreater}= 0.},

We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure profiles of the high redshift ({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.89) galaxy cluster {CLJ} 1226.9+3332 as inferred from {SZ} data from the {MUSTANG}, {NIKA}, Bolocam, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments, which all probe different angular scales.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Our non-parametric algorithm makes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For {MUSTANG}, {NIKA}, and Bolocam we derive a non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good agreement among the instruments. In particular, we find that the non-parametric profiles are consistent with a fitted generalized Navaro-Frenk-White ({gNFW}) profile. Given the ability of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} to constrain the total signal, we include a prior on the integrated Compton {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater} parameter as determined by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. For a given instrument, constraints on the pressure profile diminish rapidly beyond the field of view. The overlap in spatial scales probed by these four datasets is therefore critical in checking for consistency between instruments.

Ongoing and upcoming surveys will start to identify the underlying physics of these new phenomena, including tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy, the viability of modified gravity, the existence of extra light species, the masses of the neutrinos, and the potential of the field that drove inflation. Even after the Stage {IV} experiments, {DESI} and {LSST}, complete their surveys, there will still be much information left in the sky. This additional information will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark universe at an even deeper level and, in case Stage {IV} surveys find hints for physics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our current view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid {DESI} and {LSST} in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage {IV} can fully exploit this regime. These ideas flow to potential projects that could start construction in the 2020's.},

Our analysis uses the same shear and source photometric redshifts estimates as were used in the {DES} combined probes analysis. Our analysis results in surprisingly low values for S8=σ8(Ωm/0.3)0.5=0.65±0.04, driven by a low matter density parameter, Ωm=0.179+0.031−0.038, with σ8−Ωm posteriors in 2.4σ tension with the {DES} Y1 3x2pt results, and in 5.6σ with the Planck {CMB} analysis. These results include the impact of post-unblinding changes to the analysis, which did not improve the level of consistency with other data sets compared to the results obtained at the unblinding. The fact that multiple cosmological probes (supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and {CMB} anisotropies), and other galaxy cluster analyses all favor significantly higher matter densities suggests the presence of systematic errors in the data or an incomplete modeling of the relevant physics. Cross checks with x-ray and microwave data, as well as independent constraints on the observable-mass relation from Sunyaev-Zeldovich selected clusters, suggest that the discrepancy resides in our modeling of the weak lensing signal rather than the cluster abundance. Repeating our analysis using a higher richness threshold (λ≥30) significantly reduces the tension with other probes, and points to one or more richness-dependent effects not captured by our model.},

Using the X-ray data, we derive total mass profiles under the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. The central regions of {RXC} J0216.7-4749 are found to be dominated by an X-ray bright {AGN}, and although we derive a mass profile, uncertainties are large and the constraints are significantly weakened due to the presence of the central source. The total mass profile of {RXC} J2315.7-0222 is of high quality, being measured in fifteen bins from [0.075–0.75] {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and containing three data points interior to 30 kpc, allowing comprehensive investigation of its properties. We investigate several mass models based on the standard {NFW} profile or on the Sérsic-like model recently suggested by high-resolution {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-body simulations. We find that the addition of a stellar component due to the presence of the central galaxy is necessary for a good analytical model fit. In all mass profile models fitted, the mass concentration is not especially high compared to non-fossil systems. In addition, the modification of the dark matter halo by adiabatic contraction slightly improves the fit. However, our result depends critically on the choice of {IMF} used to convert galaxy luminosity to mass, which leads to a degeneracy between the central slope of the dark matter profile and the normalisation of the stellar component. While we argue on the basis of the range of /{\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ratios that lower /{\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ratios are preferred on physical grounds and that adiabatic contraction has thus operated in this system, better theoretical and observational convergence on this problem is needed to make further progess.},

Fluxes range from 1 to 10 000 Jy (at the frequencies covering 143 to 545 {GHz}). All sources are either planets (2) or of galactic origin. The longitude range is from 75 to 198 degrees. Some of the sources are associated with the well-known Lynds Nebulae and {HII} compact regions in the galactic plane. A large fraction of the sources have an {IRAS} counterpart. Except for Jupiter, Saturn, the Crab and Cas A, all sources show a dust-emission-like modified blackbody emission spectrum. Temperatures cover a range from 7 to 27 K. For the coldest sources ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 10 K), a steep emissivity law is found with a surprising {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 3 to 4. An inverse relationship between {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is observed. The number density of sources at 353 {GHz} with flux brighter than 100 Jy is of the order of 1 per degree of Galactic longitude. These sources will provide a strong check for the calibration of the Planck {HFI} focal plane geometry as a complement to planets. These very cold sources observed by Archeops should be prime targets for mapping observations by the Akari and Herschel space missions and ground-based observatories.},

	abstract = {Use of errors-in-variables models is appropriate in many practical experimental problems. However, inference based on such models is by no means straightforward. In previous analyses, simplifying assumptions have been made in order to ease this intractability, but assumptions of this nature are unfortunate and restrictive. In this paper, we analyse errors-in-variables models in full generality under a Bayesian formulation. In order to compute the necessary posterior distributions, we utilize various computational techniques. Two specific non-linear errors-in-variables regression examples are considered; the first is a re-analysed Berkson-type model, and the second is a classical errors-in-variables model. Our analyses are compared and contrasted with those presented else-where in the literature.},

Here we present the data set and study the differences to observations for fundamental galaxy cluster properties and scaling relations. We find that the modelled galaxy clusters are generally in reasonable agreement with observations with respect to baryonic fractions and gas scaling relations at redshift \$z\$ = 0. However, there are still some (model-dependent) differences, such as central galaxies being too massive, and galaxy colours (g − r) being bluer (about 0.2 dex lower at the peak position) than in observations. The agreement in gas scaling relations down to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\{\{{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm \{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\}\}\}\$ between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations. We also include – where appropriate – a comparison to three semi-analytical galaxy formation models as applied to the same underlying dark-matter-only simulation. All simulations and derived data products are publicly available.},

	abstract = {Big bang nucleosynthesis ({BBN}) describes the production of the lightest nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the first seconds of cosmic time. A brief overview of the essentials of this physics is given, and new calculations presented of light-element abundances through 6Li and 7Li, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. Fits are provided for these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors Nν. Recent developments are reviewed in {BBN}, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff. These measurements allow for a tight test of {BBN} and cosmology using {CMB} data alone. Our likelihood analysis
convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our {BBN} output and
observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of {BBN}. A new determination of the primordial helium abundance is included in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions and are consistent with the standard model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of Nν when combined with the {CMB} baryon density and provides a 2 σ upper limit Nν{\textless}3.2 . The new precision of
the {CMB} and D/H observations together leaves D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in {BBN} calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross-section data. In contrast with D/H and 4He, 7Li predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics. This paper concludes with a look at future directions including key nuclear reactions, astronomical observations, and theoretical issues.},

As current detectors of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) already have sensitivities comparable to the noise arising from the random arrival of {CMB} photons, the further gains in sensitivity needed to probe the very early Universe will have to arise from large arrays. A similar situation is encountered at other wavelengths. Single-pixel X-ray detectors now have a resolving power of ΔE {\textless} 5eV for single 6-{keV} photons,
and future X-ray astronomy missions anticipate the need for 1,000-pixel arrays. Here we report the demonstration of a superconducting detector that is easily fabricated and can readily be incorporated into such an array. Its sensitivity is already within an order of magnitude of that needed for {CMB} observations, and its energy resolution is similarly close to the targets required for future X-ray astronomy missions.},

The particular case of linear fit with errors on both axes and extra variance of the data points around the straight line (i.e. not accounted by the experimental errors) is shown in detail.

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints obtained from galaxy clusters identified by their Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect signature in the 2500 square-degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel’dovich ({SPT}-{SZ}) survey. We consider the 377 cluster candidates identified at z{\textbackslash}gt 0.25 with a detection significance greater than five, corresponding to the 95\% purity threshold for the survey. We compute constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling relations. Assuming a spatially flat Λ{CDM} cosmology, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and find \{σ \}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}8{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.784+/- 0.039 and \{\{\{Ω \}\}\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.289+/- 0.042, with the parameter combination \{σ \}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}8{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\{(\{\{\{Ω \}\}\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}/0.27)\}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}0.3{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}=0.797+/- 0.031. These results are in good agreement with constraints from the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) from {SPT}, {WMAP}, and Planck, as well as with constraints from other cluster data sets. We also consider several extensions to Λ{CDM}, including models in which the equation of state of dark energy w, the species-summed neutrino mass, and/or the effective number of relativistic species (\{N\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\}) are free parameters. When combined with constraints from the Planck {CMB}, H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, baryon acoustic oscillation, and {SNe}, adding the {SPT} cluster data improves the w constraint by 14\%, to w=-1.023+/- 0.042.},

follow-up data collected within the 2500 deg2 South Pole

calibrating the richness-mass relation of the optically selected
{redMaPPer} catalog, enable the cosmological exploitation of the {DES}
cluster abundance data. To explore possible systematics related to the
modeling of projection effects, we consider two calibrations of the
observational scatter on richness estimates: a simple Gaussian model
which account only for the background contamination ({BKG}), and a model
which further includes contamination and incompleteness due to
projection effects ({PRJ}). Assuming either a Λ {CDM}
+∑mν or w {CDM} +∑mν cosmology, and
for both scatter models, we derive cosmological constraints consistent
with multiple cosmological probes of the low and high redshift Universe,
and in particular with the {SPT} cluster abundance data. This result
demonstrates that the {DES} Y1 and {SPT} cluster counts provide consistent
cosmological constraints, if the same mass calibration data set is
adopted. It thus supports the conclusion of the {DES} Y1 cluster cosmology
analysis which interprets the tension observed with other cosmological
probes in terms of systematics affecting the stacked weak lensing
analysis of optically selected low-richness clusters. Finally, we
analyze the first combined optically {SZ} selected cluster catalog
obtained by including the {SPT} sample above the maximum redshift probed
by the {DES} Y1 {redMaPPer} sample (z =0.65 ). Besides providing a mild
improvement of the cosmological constraints, this data combination
serves as a stricter test of our scatter models: the {PRJ} model,
providing scaling relations consistent between the two abundance and
multiwavelength follow-up data, is favored over the {BKG} model.},

As a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, the {SZE} is insensitive to the redshift of the galaxy cluster, making it well-suited for studies of clusters at all redshifts, and especially at reasonably high redshifts (z {\textgreater} 1) where the abundance of clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology. Recent high signal-to-noise detections of the {SZE} have enabled interesting constraints on the Hubble constant and the matter density of the universe using small samples of galaxy clusters. Upcoming {SZE} surveys are expected to find hundreds to thousands of new galaxy clusters, with a mass selection function that is remarkably uniform with redshift. In this review we provide an overview of the {SZE} and its use for cosmological studies with emphasis on the cosmology that can, in principle, be extracted from {SZE} survey yields. We discuss the observational and theoretical challenges that must be met before precise cosmological constraints can be extracted from the survey yields.},

In particular, we find that using the transfer functions for cold dark matter ({CDM}) + baryons in the computation of the halo mass function, instead of the transfer functions including neutrino perturbations, as prescribed in recent work, yields an ≍0.25 per cent downward shift of the σ8 constraint from {tSZ} power spectrum data, with a fiducial neutrino mass Σmν = 0.06 {eV}. In Λ{CDM}, with an X-ray mass bias corresponding to the expected hydrostatic mass bias, i.e. (1 - b) ≃ 0.8, our constraints from Planck {SZ} data are consistent with the latest results from {SPT}, {DES}-Y1, and {KiDS}+{VIKING}-450. In νΛ{CDM}, our joint analyses of Planck {SZ} with Planck 2015 primary {CMB} yield a small improvement on the total neutrino mass bound compared to the Planck 2015 primary {CMB} constraint, as well as (1 - b) = 0.64 ± 0.04 (68 per cent {CL}). For forecasts, we find that competitive neutrino mass measurements using cosmic variance limited {SZ} power spectrum require masking the heaviest clusters and probing the small-scale {SZ} power spectrum up to ℓmax ≍ 104. Although this is challenging, we find that {SZ} power spectrum can realistically be used to tightly constrain intracluster medium properties: we forecast a 2 per cent determination of the X-ray mass bias by combining {CMB}-S4 and our mock {SZ} power spectrum with ℓmax = 103.},

	doi = {10.1086/313427},
	abstract = {In the construction of an X-ray-selected sample of galaxy clusters for 
cosmological studies, we have assembled a sample of 495 X-ray sources
found to show extended X-ray emission in the first processing of the
{ROSAT} All-Sky Survey. The sample covers the celestial region with
declination δ{\textgreater}=0deg and Galactic latitude
{\textbar}{bII}{\textbar}{\textgreater}=20deg and comprises sources with a count
rate {\textgreater}=0.06 counts s-1 and a source extent likelihood of
L{\textgreater}=7. In an optical follow-up identification program we find 378
(76\%) of these sources to be clusters of galaxies.

It was necessary to reanalyze the sources in this sample with a new
X-ray source characterization technique to provide more precise values
for the X-ray flux and source extent than obtained from the standard
processing. This new method, termed growth curve analysis ({GCA}), has the
advantage over previous methods in its ability to be robust, to be easy
to model and to integrate into simulations, to provide diagnostic plots
for visual inspection, and to make extensive use of the X-ray data. The
source parameters obtained assist the source identification and provide
more precise X-ray fluxes. This reanalysis is based on data from the
more recent second processing of the {ROSAT} Survey. We present a catalog
of the cluster sources with the X-ray properties obtained as well as a
list of the previously flagged extended sources that are found to have a
noncluster counterpart. We discuss the process of source identification
from the combination of optical and X-ray data.

To investigate the overall completeness of the cluster sample as a
function of the X-ray flux limit, we extend the search for X-ray cluster
sources to the data of the second processing of the {ROSAT} Survey for the
northern sky region between 9h and 14h in right
ascension. We include the search for X-ray emission of known clusters as
well as a new investigation of extended X-ray sources. In the course of
this search we find X-ray emission from 85 additional Abell clusters and
56 very probable cluster candidates among the newly found extended
sources. A comparison of the X-ray cluster number counts of the {NORAS}
sample with the {ROSAT}-{ESO} Flux-limited X-Ray ({REFLEX}) Cluster Survey
results leads to an estimate of the completeness of the {NORAS} sample of
{ROSAT} All-Sky Survey ({RASS}) I extended clusters of about 50\% at an X-ray
flux of {FX}(0.1-2.4 {keV})=3×10-12 ergs
s-1 cm-2. The estimated completeness achieved by
adding the supplementary sample in the study area amounts to about 82\%
in comparison to {REFLEX}. The low completeness introduces an uncertainty
in the use of the sample for cosmological statistical studies that will
be cured with the completion of the continuing Northern {ROSAT} All-Sky
({NORAS}) Cluster Survey project.

Results reported here are based on observations made with the Multiple
Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and
the University of Arizona.},

	abstract = {For precision cosmological studies it is important to know the local properties of the reference point from which we observe the Universe. Particularly for the determination of the Hubble constant with low-redshift distance indicators, the values observed depend on the average matter density within the distance range covered. In this study we used the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution in the local Universe. The study is based on our {CLASSIX} galaxy cluster survey, which is highly complete and well characterised, where galaxy clusters are detected by their X-ray emission. In total, 1653 galaxy clusters outside the “zone of avoidance” fulfil the selection criteria and are involved in this study. We find a local underdensity in the cluster distribution of about 30–60\% which extends about 85 Mpc to the north and ∼170 Mpc to the south. We study the density distribution as a function of redshift in detail in several regions in the sky. For three regions for which the galaxy density distribution has previously been studied, we find good agreement between the density distribution of clusters and galaxies. Correcting for the bias in the cluster distribution we infer an underdensity in the matter distribution of about −30 ± 15\% (−20 ± 10\%) in a region with a radius of about 100 (∼140) Mpc. Calculating the probability of finding such an underdensity through structure formation theory in a Λ{CDM} universe with concordance cosmological parameters, we find a probability characterised by {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-values of 1.3 − 3.7. This indicates low probabilities, but with values of around 10\% at the lower uncertainty limit, the existence of an underdensity cannot be ruled out. Inside this underdensity, the observed Hubble parameter will be larger by about , which explains part of the discrepancy between the locally measured value of {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} compared to the value of the Hubble parameter inferred from the Planck observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. If distance indicators outside the local underdensity are included, as in many modern analyses, this effect is diluted.},

For the {ICM}, which is heated to X-ray radiating temperatures, X-ray spectroscopy is the most important tool to obtain insight into the structure and astrophysics of galaxy clusters. The {ICM} is also the hottest plasma that can be well studied under thermal equilibrium conditions. In this review we recall the basic principles of the interpretation of X-ray spectra from a hot, tenuous plasma and we illustrate the wide range of scientific applications of X-ray spectroscopy. The determination of galaxy cluster masses, the most important prerequisite for using clusters in cosmological studies, rest crucially on a precise spectroscopic determination of the {ICM} temperature distribution. The study of the thermal structure of the {ICM} provides a very interesting fossil record of the energy release during galaxy formation and evolution, giving important constraints on galaxy formation models. The temperature and pressure distribution of the {ICM} gives us important insight into the process of galaxy cluster merging and the dissipation of the merger energy in form of turbulent motion. Cooling cores in the centers of about half of the cluster population are interesting laboratories to investigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation and energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy. The element abundances deduced from X-ray spectra of the {ICM} provide a cosmic history record of the contribution of different supernovae to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements and their spatial distribution partly reflects important transport processes in the {ICM}. Some discussion of plasma diagnostics for conditions out of thermal equilibrium and an outlook on the future prospects of X-ray spectroscopic cluster studies complete our review.},

Clusters are identified via the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich ({SZ}) effect and confirmed with a combination of archival and targeted follow-up data, making particular use of data from the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}). With incomplete follow-up we have confirmed as clusters 244 of 266 candidates at a detection significance ξ ≥ 5 and an additional 204 systems at 4 4 threshold, and 10\% of their measured {SZ} flux. We associate {SZ}-selected clusters, from both {SPT}-{ECS} and the {SPT}-{SZ} survey, with clusters from the {DES} {redMaPPer} sample, and we find an offset distribution between the {SZ} center and central galaxy in general agreement with previous work, though with a larger fraction of clusters with significant offsets. Adopting a fixed Planck-like cosmology, we measure the optical richness–{SZ} mass () relation and find it to be 28\% shallower than that from a weak-lensing analysis of the {DES} data—a difference significant at the 4σ level—with the relations intersecting at λ = 60. The {SPT}-{ECS} cluster sample will be particularly useful for studying the evolution of massive clusters and, in combination with {DES} lensing observations and the {SPT}-{SZ} cluster sample, will be an important component of future cosmological analyses.},

information on the X-ray properties, redshifts, and some identification
details of the clusters in the {REFLEX} sample. The catalogue describes a
statistically complete X-ray flux-limited sample of 447 galaxy clusters
above an X-ray flux of 3 × 10-12 erg s-1
cm-2 (0.1 to 2.4 {keV}) in an area of 4.24 ster in the southern
sky. The cluster candidates were first selected by their X-ray emission
in the {ROSAT}-All Sky Survey and subsequently spectroscopically
identified in the frame of an {ESO} key programme. Previously described
tests have shown that the sample is more than 90\% complete and there is
a conservative upper limit of 9\% on the fraction of clusters with a
dominant X-ray contamination from {AGN}. In addition to the cluster
catalogue we also describe the complete selection criteria as a function
of the sky position and the conversion functions used to analyse the
X-ray data. These are essential for the precise statistical analysis of
the large-scale cluster distribution. This data set is at present the
largest, statistically complete X-ray galaxy cluster sample. Together
with these data set we also provide for the first time the full
three-dimensional selection function. The sample forms the basis of
several cosmological studies, one of the most important applications
being the assessment of the statistics of the large-scale structure of
the universe and the test of cosmological models. Part of these
cosmological results have already been published.

Based on observations at the European Southern Observatory La Silla,

	abstract = {We derive cosmological constraints using a galaxy cluster sample selected from the 2500 deg2 {SPT}-{SZ} survey. The sample spans the redshift range 0.25 5. The sample is supplemented with optical weak gravitational lensing measurements of 32 clusters with 0.29 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.13 (from Magellan and Hubble Space Telescope) and X-ray measurements of 89 clusters with 0.25 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.75 (from Chandra). We rely on minimal modeling assumptions: (i) weak lensing provides an accurate means of measuring halo masses, (ii) the mean {SZ} and X-ray observables are related to the true halo mass through power-law relations in mass and dimensionless Hubble parameter E(z) with a priori unknown parameters, and (iii) there is (correlated, lognormal) intrinsic scatter and measurement noise relating these observables to their mean relations. We simultaneously fit for these astrophysical modeling parameters and for cosmology. Assuming a flat νΛ{CDM} model, in which the sum of neutrino masses is a free parameter, we measure Ωm = 0.276 ± 0.047, σ 8 = 0.781 ± 0.037, and σ 8(Ωm/0.3)0.2 = 0.766 ±0.025. The redshift evolutions of the X-ray Y X–mass and M gas–mass relations are both consistent with self-similar evolution to within 1σ. The mass slope of the Y X–mass relation shows a 2.3σ deviation from self-similarity. Similarly, the mass slope of the M gas–mass relation is steeper than self-similarity at the 2.5σ level. In a ν{wCDM} cosmology, we measure the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = −1.55 ± 0.41 from the cluster data. We perform a measurement of the growth of structure since redshift z ∼ 1.7 and find no evidence for tension with the prediction from general relativity. This is the first analysis of the {SPT} cluster sample that uses direct weak-lensing mass calibration and is a step toward using the much larger weak-lensing data set from {DES}. We provide updated redshift and mass estimates for the {SPT} sample.},

This work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at high significance in the 2500 deg2 {SPT}-{SZ} survey, which was completed in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of ξ = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared ({NIR}) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76\%) of the ξ {\textgreater} 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95\%) of the ξ {\textgreater} 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in {SPT} data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or {NIR} counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z ∼ 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c(ρcrit) , the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z {\textgreater} 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {We study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clusters resulting from fitting a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk, \& White model to the reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak-lensing ({WL}) observations. The reduced shear profiles are generated for ≈104 cluster-sized halos formed in a Λ{CDM} cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 h -1 Gpc box. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the {WL} masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections along the line of sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is ≈20\% for massive clusters and can be as high as ≈30\% for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that {WL} mass measurements can have a small, ≈5\%-10\%, but non-negligible amount of bias. Given that {WL} measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to calibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmological constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias requires detailed simulations that include more observational effects than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each specific {WL} mass estimation method, as the details of the method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method for estimating mass M 500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.},

Here we present a pilot X-ray study of the five most massive ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater} {\textgreater} {\textless}i/{\textgreater} 5 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), distant ({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1), clusters detected via the Sunyaev-Zel’Dovich effect. We optimally combine {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} X-ray observations by leveraging the throughput of {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} to obtain spatially-resolved spectroscopy, and the spatial resolution of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} to probe the bright inner parts and to detect embedded point sources. Capitalising on the excellent agreement in flux-related measurements, we present a new method to derive the density profiles, which are constrained in the centre by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and in the outskirts by {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We show that the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-{\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} combination is fundamental for morphological analysis at these redshifts, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} resolution being required to remove point source contamination, and the {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sensitivity allowing higher significance detection of faint substructures. Measuring the morphology using images from both instruments, we found that the sample is dominated by dynamically disturbed objects. We use the combined {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-{\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} density profiles and spatially-resolved temperature profiles to investigate thermodynamic quantities including entropy and pressure. From comparison of the scaled profiles with the local {REXCESS} sample, we find no significant departure from standard self-similar evolution, within the dispersion, at any radius, except for the entropy beyond 0.7 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. The baryon mass fraction tends towards the cosmic value, with a weaker dependence on mass than that observed in the local Universe. We make a comparison with the predictions from numerical simulations. The present pilot study demonstrates the utility and feasibility of spatially-resolved analysis of individual objects at high-redshift through the combination of {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations. Observations of a larger sample will allow a fuller statistical analysis to be undertaken, in particular of the intrinsic scatter in the structural and scaling properties of the cluster population.},

The large {SDSS}-{II} sample provides an effective, independent, low-{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {SN} sample. For a flat Λ{CDM} cosmology, we find Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) measurement from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck {\textless}i/{\textgreater}and {WMAP} experiments. Our result is 1.8{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of {SNLS} three-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the {SNLS} photometric calibration. When combined with {CMB} constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater} =−1.018 ± 0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements gives similar constraints: {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater} =−1.027 ± 0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints to date on the nature of dark energy.},

Measurements of the effect provide distinctly different information about cluster properties than X-ray imaging data, while combining X-ray and Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect data leads to new insights into the structures of cluster atmospheres. The effect is redshift-independent, and so provides a unique probe of the structure of the Universe on the largest scales. The present review discusses the theory of the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect and collects published results for many clusters, presents the overall conclusions that may be drawn from the detections so far, and discusses the prospects for future research on the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effects.},

	abstract = {Surveys in the next decade will deliver large samples of galaxy clusters that transform our understanding of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and cosmology studies will become systematics limited with samples of this magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this is only realized if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way. Here we introduce the {MOCK}-X analysis framework, a multiwavelength tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological simulations and derives halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating optical, Compton-y and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image analysis method, we demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring hydrostatic mass bias for the {IllustrisTNG}, {BAHAMAS} and {MACSIS} simulations. Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant bias b ≍ 0.13 with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or subgrid physics. However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic observations is mass-dependent, increasing to b = 0.3 for the most massive clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure equilibrium. The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence. The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current observations and future surveys will contain sufficient samples of massive clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic bias.},

Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich ({SZ}) sources catalogue, the {PSZ}1. The results
presented here were achieved during the second year of a two-year
observational programme, the {ITP}13, developed at the Roque de los
Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). Using the 2.5 m Isaac Newton
telescope, the 3.5 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, the 4.2 m William
Herschel telescope and the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias we
characterised 75 {SZ} sources with low {SZ} significance, {SZ} S/N {\textless} 5.32.
We performed deep optical imaging and spectroscopy in order to associate
actual galaxy clusters with the {SZ} Planck source. We adopted robust
criteria, based on the 2D spatial distribution, richness, and velocity
dispersions to confirm actual optical counterparts up to z {\textless} 0.85.
The selected systems are confirmed only if they are well aligned with
respect to the {PSZ}1 coordinate and show high richness and high velocity
dispersion. In addition, we also inspected the Compton y-maps and {SZ}
significance in order to identify unrealistic detections. Following this
procedure, we identify 26 cluster counterparts associated with the {SZ}
emission, which means that only about 35\% of the clusters considered in
this low S/N {PSZ}1 subsample are validated. Forty-nine {SZ} sources
(∼65\% of this {PSZ}1 subset) remain unconfirmed. At the end of the
{ITP}13 observational programme, we have studied 256 {SZ} sources with Dec
≥ -15° (212 of them completely unknown), finding optical
counterparts for 152 {SZ} sources. The {ITP}13 validation programme has
allowed us to update the {PSZ}1 purity, which is now more refined,
increasing from 72\% to 83\% in the low {SZ} S/N regime. Our results are
consistent with the predicted purity curve for the full {PSZ}1 catalogue
and with the expected fraction of false detections caused by the
non-Gaussian noise of foreground signals. We find a strong correlation
between the number of unconfirmed sources and the thermal emission of
diffuse galactic dust at 857 {GHz}, thus increasing the fraction of false
Planck {SZ} detections at low galactic latitudes.},

	abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏω. It is
favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive
interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average
(ℏω)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A
mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0°K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

instruments of the Planck mission. It will observe the whole sky in six
bands in the 100 {GHz}-1 {THz} range. Aims: The {HFI} instrument is
designed to measure the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) with a
sensitivity limited only by fundamental sources: the photon noise of the
{CMB} itself and the residuals left after the removal of foregrounds. The
two high frequency bands will provide full maps of the submillimetre
sky, featuring mainly extended and point source foregrounds. Systematic
effects must be kept at negligible levels or accurately monitored so
that the signal can be corrected. This paper describes the {HFI} design
and its characteristics deduced from ground tests and calibration. Methods: The {HFI} instrumental concept and architecture are feasible
only by pushing new techniques to their extreme capabilities, mainly:
(i) bolometers working at 100 {mK} and absorbing the radiation in grids;
(ii) a dilution cooler providing 100 {mK} in microgravity conditions;
(iii) a new type of {AC} biased readout electronics and (iv) optical
channels using devices inspired from radio and infrared techniques. Results: The Planck-{HFI} instrument performance exceeds requirements
for sensitivity and control of systematic effects. During ground-based
calibration and tests, it was measured at instrument and system levels
to be close to or better than the goal specification.},

measurements have been plagued by relatively large errors in the
observational data and severe biases induced, for example, by cluster
triaxiality and clumpiness. The advent of Planck allows us to map the
Compton parameter y, that is, the amplitude of the {SZ} effect, with
unprecedented accuracy at intermediate cluster-centric radii, which in
turn allows performing a detailed spatially resolved comparison with
X-ray measurements. Given such higher quality observational data, we
developed a Bayesian approach that combines informed priors on the
physics of the intracluster medium obtained from hydrodynamical
simulations of massive clusters with measurement uncertainties. We
applied our method to a sample of 61 galaxy clusters with redshifts up

These models predict very rapid negative evolution, in conflict with the clusters investigated by Gunn (1990). Self-similar models are applied to the new determination of the temperature and luminosity functions. For a spectral index greater than approximately -1, the evolution of the {TF} is found to be acceptable, but the evolution of the {LF} is in the opposite sense from that observed. A simple 'preheated intergalactic medium' model for X-ray cluster
formation is introduced. It is shown that this model accounts quite well for the observed correlations of gross properties of clusters. This is applied to make concrete predictions for the evolution of the {LF}.},

	abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}). The {LSST} design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. {LSST} will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will
have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the {LSST} science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

	abstract = {High-resolution mapping of the intracluster medium ({ICM}) up to high redshift and down to low masses is crucial to derive accurate mass estimates of the galaxy cluster and to understand the systematic effects affecting cosmological studies based on galaxy clusters. We present a spatially resolved Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({SZ})/X-ray analysis of {ACT}-{CL} J0215.4+0030, a high-redshift ({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.865) galaxy cluster of intermediate mass ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≃ 3.5 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) observed as part of the ongoing {NIKA}2 {SZ} large program, which is a follow-up of a representative sample of objects at 0.5 ≤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≤ 0.9. In addition to the faintness and small angular size induced by its mass and redshift, the cluster is contaminated by point sources that significantly affect the {SZ} signal. This is therefore an interesting case study for the most challenging sources of the {NIKA}2 cluster sample. We present the {NIKA}2 observations of this cluster and the resulting data. We identified the point sources that affect the {NIKA}2 maps of the cluster as submillimeter galaxies with counterparts in catalogs of sources constructed by the {SPIRE} instrument on board the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observatory. We reconstructed the {ICM} pressure profile by performing a joint analysis of the {SZ} signal and of the point-source component in the {NIKA}2 150 {GHz} map. This cluster is a very weak source that lies below the selection limit of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} catalog. Nonetheless, we obtained high-quality estimates of the {ICM} thermodynamical properties with {NIKA}2. We compared the pressure profile extracted from the {NIKA}2 map to the pressure profile obtained from X-ray data alone by deprojecting the public {\textless}i{\textgreater}{XMM}-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations of the cluster. We combined the {NIKA}2 pressure profile with the X-ray deprojected density to extract detailed information on the {ICM}. The radial distribution of its thermodynamic properties (the pressure, temperature and entropy) indicate that the cluster has a highly disturbed core. We also computed the hydrostatic mass of the cluster, which is compatible with estimations from {SZ} and X-ray scaling relations. We conclude that the {NIKA}2 {SZ} large program can deliver quality information on the thermodynamics of the {ICM} even for one of its faintest clusters after a careful treatment of the contamination by point sources.},

The catalog contains 89 candidates detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 4.6. The candidates are selected using the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect at 95 and 150 {GHz}. Using both space- and ground-based optical and infrared telescopes, we have confirmed 81 candidates as galaxy clusters. We use these follow-up images and archival images to estimate photometric redshifts for 66 galaxy clusters and spectroscopic observations to obtain redshifts for 13 systems. An additional two galaxy clusters are confirmed using the overdensity of near-infrared galaxies only and are presented without redshifts. We find that 15 candidates (18\% of the total sample) are at redshift z ≥ 1.0, with a maximum confirmed redshift of . We expect this catalog to contain every galaxy cluster with and z {\textgreater} 0.25 in the survey area. The mass threshold is approximately constant above z = 0.25, and the complete catalog has a median mass of approximately . Compared to previous {SPT} works, the increased depth of the millimeter-wave data (11.2 and 6.5 μK-arcmin at 95 and 150 {GHz}, respectively) makes it possible to find more galaxy clusters at high redshift and lower mass.},

In this work, we have performed a statistical analysis of the {tSZ} spectral distortion on large galaxy cluster samples. We performed a stacking analysis for several electronic temperature bins, using both spectroscopic measurements of X-ray temperatures and a scaling relation between X-ray luminosities and electronic temperatures. We report the first high significance detection of the relativistic {tSZ} at a significance of 5.3{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We also demonstrate that the observed {tSZ} relativistic corrections are consistent with X-ray deduced temperatures. This measurement of the {tSZ} spectral law demonstrates that {tSZ} effect spectral distorsion can be used as a probe to measure galaxy cluster temperatures.},

	abstract = {Determinations of the motion of the sun with respect to the extra-galactic  
nebulae have involved a K term of several hundred kilometers which appears
to be variable. Explanations of this paradox have been sought in a correlation
between apparent radial velocities and distances, but so far the results have
not been convincing. The present paper is a re-examination of the question,
based on only those nebular distances which are believed to be fairly reliable.

Distances of extra-galactic nebulae depend ultimately upon the application of
absolute-luminosity criteria to involved stars whose types can be recognized.
These include, among others, Cepheid variables, novae, and blue stars involved
in emission nebulosity. Numerical values depend upon the zero point of the
period-luminosity relation among Cepheids, the other criteria merely check the
order of the distances. This method is restricted to the few nebulae which are
well resolved by existing instruments. A study of these nebulae, together
with those in which any stars at all can be recognized, indicates the
probability of an approximately uniform upper limit to the absolute luminosity
of stars, in the late-type spirals and irregular nebulae at least, of the
order of M (photographic) = -6.3. The apparent luminosities of the brightest
stars in such nebulae are thus criteria which, although rough and to be
applied with caution, furnish reasonable estimates of the distances of all
extra-galactic systems in which even a few stars can be detected.},

	abstract = {We use the largest complete sample of 64 galaxy clusters ({HIghest} X-ray {FLUx} Galaxy Cluster Sample) with available high-quality X-ray data from Chandra, and apply 16 cool-core diagnostics to them, some of them new. In order to identify the best parameter for characterizing cool-core clusters and quantify its relation to other parameters, we mainly use very high spatial resolution profiles of central gas density and temperature, and quantities derived from them. We also correlate optical properties of brightest cluster galaxies ({BCGs}) with X-ray properties. To segregate cool core and non-cool-core clusters, we find that central cooling time, {\textless}i{\textgreater}t{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}cool{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, is the best parameter for low redshift clusters with high quality data, and that cuspiness is the best parameter for high redshift clusters. 72\% of clusters in our sample have a cool core ({\textless}i{\textgreater}t{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}cool{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 7.7 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}71{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1/2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} Gyr) and 44\% have strong cool cores ({\textless}i{\textgreater}t{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}cool{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 1.0 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}71{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1/2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} Gyr). We find strong cool-core clusters are characterized as having low central entropy and a systematic central temperature drop. Weak cool-core clusters have enhanced central entropies and temperature profiles that are flat or decrease slightly towards the center. Non-cool-core clusters have high central entropies. For the first time we show quantitatively that the discrepancy in classical and spectroscopic mass deposition rates can not be explained with a recent formation of the cool cores, demonstrating the need for a heating mechanism to explain the cooling flow problem. We find that strong cool-core clusters have a distribution of central temperature drops, centered on 0.4{\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}vir{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. However, the radius at which the temperature begins to drop varies. This lack of a universal inner temperature profile probably reflects the complex physics in cluster cores not directly related to the cluster as a whole. Our results suggest that the central temperature does not correlate with the mass of the {BCGs} and weakly correlates with the expected radiative cooling only for strong cool-core clusters. Since 88\% of the clusters in our sample have a {BCG} within a projected distance of 50 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}71{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} kpc from the X-ray peak, we argue that it is easier to heat the gas (e.g. with mergers or non-gravitational processes) than to separate the dense core from the brightest cluster galaxy. Diffuse, Mpc-scale radio emission, believed to be associated with major mergers, has not been unambiguously detected in any of the strong cool-core clusters in our sample. Of the weak cool-core clusters and non-cool-core clusters, most of the clusters (seven out of eight) that have diffuse, Mpc-scale radio emission have a large ({\textgreater} 50 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}71{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} kpc) projected separation between their {BCG} and X-ray peak. In contrast, only two of the 56 clusters with a small separation between the {BCG} and X-ray peak ({\textless}i{\textgreater}{\textless}{\textless}i/{\textgreater}50 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}71{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} kpc) show large-scale radio emission. Based on this result, we argue that a large projected separation between the {BCG} and the X-ray peak is a good indicator of a major merger. The properties of weak cool-core clusters as an intermediate class of objects are discussed. Finally we describe individual properties of all 64 clusters in the sample.},

A range of analysis tools have been run in situ to enable a diverse set of science projects and, at the same time, keep the resulting data amount manageable. Analysis outputs have been generated starting at redshift z ∼ 10 to allow for construction of synthetic galaxy catalogs using a semianalytic modeling approach in postprocessing. As part of our in situ analysis pipeline, we employ a new method for tracking halo substructures, introducing the concept of subhalo cores. The production of multiwavelength synthetic sky maps is facilitated by generating particle light cones in situ, also beginning at z ∼ 10.

many previous attempts to answer this question will overestimate the confidence level at which Λ{CDM} can be ruled out, we outline a
consistent approach to these rare clusters, which allows the question to be answered. We define three statistical measures, each of which are sensitive to changes in cluster populations arising from different modifications to the cosmological model. We also use these properties to define the ``equivalent mass at redshift zero'' for a cluster —
the mass of an equally unusual cluster today. This quantity is
independent of the observational survey in which the cluster was found, which makes it an ideal proxy for ranking the relative unusualness of clusters detected by different surveys. These methods are then used on a comprehensive sample of observed galaxy clusters and we confirm that all are less than 2σ deviations from the Λ{CDM} expectation.
Whereas we have only applied our method to galaxy clusters, it is applicable to any isolated, collapsed, halo. As motivation for future surveys, we also calculate where in the mass redshift plane the rarest halo is most likely to be found, giving information as to which objects might be the most fruitful in the search for new physics.},

precision as that reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave background
observations from Planck. The recovered S8 amplitude is low,
however, by 8.3 ± 2.6\% relative to Planck. This result builds
from a series of {KiDS}-1000 analyses where we validate our methodology
with variable depth mock galaxy surveys, our lensing calibration with
image simulations and null-tests, and our optical-to-near-infrared
redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues and a
spectroscopic-photometric clustering analysis. The systematic
uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded through as
nuisance parameters in our cosmological analysis. Inspecting the offset
between the marginalised posterior distributions, we find that the
S8-difference with Planck is driven by a tension in the
matter fluctuation amplitude parameter, σ8. We quantify
the level of agreement between the cosmic microwave background and our
large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics,
finding differences with a significance ranging between ∼3σ,
when considering the offset in S8, and ∼2σ, when
considering the full multi-dimensional parameter space.},

	abstract = {The "threshold epoch" of classical cosmology is first discussed from a classical point of view. It is shown that if the density fluctuations at this epoch are proportional to N-n (where N is the number of particles in a disturbance), then n must exactly, or very closely, equal the value 23 in order that such fluctuations develop into protogalaxies. This result is independent of the value of the threshold epoch, and of the equation of state for the very early universe. Arguments of a speculative nature are then presented which indicate that the threshold epoch occurs at the Planck density. It is also proposed that the initial conditions of galaxy formation are metric fluctuations at the threshold epoch of classical cosmology. The evidence in favor of this theory is (i) the density fluctuation obeys the n=23 rule, and (ii) the spin fluctuation gives an eventual angular momentum of the order
N43ℏ, in reasonable agrement with that of the Galaxy.},

	abstract = {The {FIRST} survey, begun over 20 years ago, provides the definitive high-resolution map of the radio sky. This Very Large Telescope ({VLA}) survey reaches a detection sensitivity of 1 {mJy} at 20 cm over a final footprint of 10,575 deg{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} that is largely coincident with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) area. Both the images and a catalog containing 946,432 sources are available through the {FIRST} Web site ({\textless}A href="http://sundog.stsci.edu"{\textgreater}http://sundog.stsci.edu{\textless}/A{\textgreater}). We record here the authoritative survey history, including hardware and software changes that affect the catalog's reliability and completeness. In particular, we use recent observations taken with the {JVLA} to test various aspects of the survey data (astrometry, {CLEAN} bias, and the flux density scale). We describe a new, sophisticated algorithm for flagging potential sidelobes in this snapshot survey, and show that fewer than 10\% of the cataloged objects are likely sidelobes, and that these are heavily concentrated at low flux densities and in the vicinity of bright sources, as expected. We also report a comparison of the survey with the {NRAO} {VLA} Sky Survey ({NVSS}), as well as a match of the {FIRST} catalog to the {SDSS} and Two Micron Sky Survey (2MASS) sky surveys. The {NVSS} match shows very good consistency in flux density scale and astrometry between the two surveys. The matches with 2MASS and {SDSS} indicate a systematic {\textasciitilde}10-20 mas astrometric error with respect to the optical reference frame in all {VLA} data that has disappeared with the advent of the {JVLA}. We demonstrate strikingly different behavior between the radio matches to stellar objects and to galaxies in the optical and {IR} surveys reflecting the different radio populations present over the flux density range 1-1000 {mJy}. As the radio flux density declines, stellar counterparts (quasars) get redder and fainter, while galaxies get brighter and have colors that initially redden but then turn bluer near the {FIRST} detection limit. Implications for future radio sky surveys are also briefly discussed. In particular, we show that for radio source identification at faint optical magnitudes, high angular resolution observations are essential, and cannot be sacrificed in exchange for high signal-to-noise data. The value of a {JVLA} survey as a complement to Square Kilometer Array precursor surveys is briefly discussed.},

These processes are dictated not only by gravity but also by gas physics, e.g., active galactic nucleus feedback and turbulence. In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties, e.g., density, temperature, pressure, and entropy, of the most massive and the most distant (seven clusters at z {\textgreater} 1.2) clusters selected by the South Pole Telescope and compare them with those of the nearby clusters (13 clusters at z {\textless} 0.1) to constrain their evolution as a function of time and radius. We find that thermodynamic properties in the outskirts of high-redshift clusters are remarkably similar to the low-redshift clusters, and their evolution follows the prediction of the self-similar model. Their intrinsic scatter is larger, indicating that the physical properties that lead to the formation and virialization of cluster outskirts show evolving variance. On the other hand, thermodynamic properties in the cluster cores deviate significantly from self-similarity, indicating that the processes that regulate the core are already in place in these very high redshift clusters. This result is supported by the unevolving physical scatter of all thermodynamic quantities in cluster cores.},

	abstract = {The Spectral and Photometric Imaging {REceiver} ({SPIRE}), is the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Space Observatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m, and an imaging Fourier-transform spectrometer ({FTS}) which covers simultaneously its whole operating range of 194–671 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m (447–1550 {GHz}). The {SPIRE} detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4´× 8´, observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6´. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 {GHz} by changing the stroke length of the {FTS} scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the {FTS} mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The {SPIRE} instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel{\textless}i/{\textgreater} cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5–2.},

In § 4 these considerations are extended to a more general system of supraconductive bodies; in this case there will be a continuous
transition process. In § 5 the disturbance of supraconductivity of a cylinder by a current flowing in the cylinder is considered in detail and Silsbee's hypothesis is confirmed. In § 6 we discuss our

	shorttitle = {{AMICO} galaxy clusters in {KiDS}-{DR}3},
	abstract = {Context. The large-scale mass distribution around dark matter haloes 
hosting galaxy clusters provides sensitive cosmological information.
Aims. In this work, we make use of a large photometric galaxy cluster
sample, constructed from the public Third Data Release of the
Kilo-Degree Survey, and the corresponding shear signal, to assess
cluster masses and test the concordance \$\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}\$-cold dark matter
(\$\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}\${CDM}) model. In particular, we study the weak gravitational
lensing effects on scales beyond the cluster virial radius, where the
signal is dominated by correlated and uncorrelated matter density
distributions along the line-of-sight. The analysed catalogue consists
of 6962 galaxy clusters, in the redshift range \$0.1 {\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 0.6\$ and
with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3.5. Methods. We perform a full
Bayesian analysis to model the stacked shear profiles of these clusters.
The adopted likelihood function considers both the small-scale 1-halo
term, used primarily to constrain the cluster structural properties, and
the 2-halo term, that can be used to constrain cosmological parameters.
Results. We find that the adopted modelling is successful to assess both
the cluster masses and the total matter density parameter, \$\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}\_M\$,
when fitting shear profiles up to the largest available scales of 35
Mpc/h. Moreover, our results provide a strong observational evidence of
the 2-halo signal in the stacked gravitational lensing of galaxy
clusters, further demonstrating the reliability of this probe for
cosmological studies. The main result of this work is a robust
constraint on \$\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}\_M\$, assuming a flat \$\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}\${CDM} cosmology. We
get \$\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}\_M = 0.29 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$, estimated from the full posterior
probability distribution, consistent with the estimates from cosmic
microwave background experiments.},

	abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are useful tools to constrain cosmological parameters, only if their masses can be correctly inferred from observations. In particular, X-ray and Sunyaev–Zeldovich ({SZ}) effect observations can be used to derive masses within the framework of the hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good control of the possible mass biases that can be introduced when this hypothesis is not valid. In this work, we analysed a set of 260 synthetic clusters from the {MUSIC} simulation project at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.82. We estimate the hydrostatic mass of the {MUSIC} clusters from X-ray only (temperature and density) and from X-ray and {SZ} (density and pressure). Then, we compare them with the true 3D dynamical mass. The biases are of the order of 20 per cent. We find that using the temperature instead of the pressure leads to a smaller bias, although the two values are compatible within 1σ. Non-thermal contributions to the total pressure support, arising from bulk motion and turbulence of the gas, are also computed and show that they are sufficient to account for this bias. We also present a study of the correlation between the mass bias and the dynamical state of the clusters. A clear correlation is shown between the relaxation state of the clusters and the bias factor. We applied the same analysis on a subsample of 32 objects, already selected for supporting the {NIKA}2 {SZ} Large Program.},

In this work we demonstrate a method to quantitatively determine the bias and uncertainties in weak-lensing mass calibration.

Accounting for shear bias and noise, photometric redshift uncertainties, mis-centering, cluster member contamination, cluster morphological diversity, and line-of-sight projections, we produce a library of shear profiles. Fitting a one-parameter model to these profiles, we extract the so-called {\textbackslash}emph\{weak lensing mass\} \$M\_{\textbackslash}text\{{WL}\}\$. Relating the weak-lensing mass to the halo mass from gravity-only simulations with the same initial conditions as the hydrodynamical simulations allows us to estimate the impact of hydrodynamical effects on cluster number counts experiments. Creating new shear libraries for \${\textbackslash}sim\$1000 different realizations of the systematics, provides a distribution of the parameters of the weak-lensing to halo mass relation, reflecting their systematic uncertainty. This result can be used as a prior for cosmological inference. We also discuss the impact of the inner fitting radius on the accuracy, and determine the outer fitting radius necessary to exclude the signal from neighboring structures. Our method is currently being applied to different Stage{\textasciitilde}{III} lensing surveys, and can easily be extended to Stage{\textasciitilde}{IV} lensing surveys.},

This package has been widely applied to probabilistic modeling problems in astrophysics where it was originally published, with some applications in other fields. When it was first released in 2012, the interface implemented in emcee was fundamentally different from the {MCMC} libraries that were popular at the time, such as {PyMC}, because it was specifically designed to work with "black box" models instead of structured graphical models. This has been a popular interface for applications in astrophysics because it is often non-trivial to implement realistic physics within the modeling frameworks required by other libraries. Since emcee's release, other libraries have been developed with similar interfaces, such as dynesty (Speagle 2019). The version 3.0 release of emcee is the first major release of the library in about 6 years and it includes a full re-write of the computational backend, several commonly requested features, and a set of new "move" implementations.},

The ever-present challenge is to reduce systematic effects, especially as greater distances are probed, and the uncertainties become larger. In this paper, we combine several recent calibrations of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch ({TRGB}) method. These calibrations are internally self-consistent at the 1\% level. New Gaia Early Data Release 3 ({EDR}3) data provide an additional consistency check, at a (lower) 5\% level of accuracy, a result of the well-documented Gaia angular covariance bias. The updated {TRGB} calibration applied to a distant sample of Type Ia supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project results in a value of the Hubble constant of Ho = 69.8 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.6 (stat) \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.6 (sys) km/s/Mpc. No statistically significant difference is found between the value of Ho based on the {TRGB} and that determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The {TRGB} results are also consistent to within 2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ with the {SHoES} and Spitzer plus {HST} Key Project Cepheid calibrations. The {TRGB} results alone do not demand additional new physics beyond the standard Lambda-{CDM} cosmological model. They have the advantage of simplicity of the underlying physics (the core He flash) and small systematic uncertainties (from extinction, metallicity and crowding). Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of both the {TRGB} and Cepheids are reviewed, and prospects for addressing the current discrepancy with future Gaia, {HST} and {JWST} observations are discussed. Resolving this discrepancy is essential for ascertaining if the claimed tension in Ho between the locally-measured and the {CMB}-inferred value is physically motivated.},

However, a perennial problem has been the mapping of optical `richness' measurements onto total cluster mass3,9-12. Emitted at a conformal distance of 14 gigaparsecs, the cosmic microwave background acts as a backlight to all intervening mass in the Universe, and therefore has been
gravitationally lensed13-15. Experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope16, South Pole Telescope17-19 and the Planck20 satellite have now detected gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background and produced large-area maps of the foreground deflecting structures. Here we present a calibration of cluster optical richness at the 10\% level by measuring the average cosmic microwave background lensing measured by Planck towards the positions of large numbers of optically selected clusters, detecting the deflection of photons by structures of total mass of order
1014 M⊙. Although mainly aimed at the study of larger-scale structures, the Planck estimate of the cosmic microwave background lensing field can be used to recover a nearly unbiased lensing signal for stacked clusters on arcminute scales15,21. This approach offers a clean measure of total cluster masses over most of cosmic history, largely independent of baryon physics.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201834837},
	abstract = {Aims: We present a study of the statistical properties of three 
velocity dispersion and mass estimators: biweight, gapper, and standard
deviation for a small number of galaxies (Ngal ≤ 75). Methods: Using a set of 73 numerically simulated galaxy clusters, we
first characterised the statistical bias and the variance for each one
of the three estimators (biweight, gapper, and standard deviation) in
the determination of the velocity dispersion and the dynamical mass of
the clusters through the σ-M relation. These results were used to
define a new set of unbiased estimators that are able to correct for
these statistical biases with a minimum increase in associated variance.
We also used the same set of numerical simulations to characterise two
other physical biases that affect the estimates: the effect of velocity
segregation on the selection of cluster members, and the effect of using
cluster members within different physical radii from the cluster centre.
 Results: The standard deviation (and its unbiased counterpart) is
the estimator with the lowest variance estimator after the biweight and
gapper. The effect of velocity segregation in the selection of galaxies
within the sub-sample of the most massive galaxies in the cluster
introduces a bias of 2\% in the velocity dispersion estimate when it is
calculated using a quarter of the most massive cluster members. We also
find a dependence of the velocity dispersion estimate on the aperture
radius as a fraction of R200. This is consistent with
previous results in the literature. Conclusions: The proposed set
of unbiased estimators effectively provides a correction of the velocity
dispersion and mass estimates from the statistical and physical effects
discussed above for small numbers of cluster members. When these new
estimators are applied to a subset of simulated observations, they can
retrieve bias-corrected values for the mean velocity dispersion and the
mean mass; the standard deviation has the lowest variance. Although for
a single galaxy cluster the statistical and physical effects discussed
here are comparable to or slightly smaller than the bias introduced by
interlopers, they are relevant when ensemble properties and scaling
relations for large number of clusters are studied.},

	abstract = {{MUSTANG} 2 is a 223 element focal plane that operates between 75 and 105 
{GHz} on the 100 meter Green Bank Telescope. It shares many of the science
goals of its predecessor, {MUSTANG}, but will have fifteen times the
sensitivity and five times the field-of-view. Angular scales from 900 to
60 will be recovered with high fidelity providing a unique overlap
between high resolution instruments such as {ALMA} and lower resolution
single dish telescopes such as {ACT} or {SPT}. Individual {TES} bolometers are
placed behind feedhorns spaced by 1.9λ f and are read out using a
microwave {SQUID} multiplexing system.},

	abstract = {La matiere sombre est omnipresente a plusieurs echelles de l'univers (galaxie, amas de galaxies, univers dans son ensemble). Cette matiere joue un role important en cosmologie et ne peut etre totalement expliquee par de la physique conventionnelle. Du point de vue de la physique des particules, il existe une extension du modele standard : le modele supersymetrique qui predit l'existence sous certaines conditions de nouvelles particules stables massives interagissant faiblement avec la matiere ordinaire. Outre la recherche active en detecteurs de ces nouvelles particules, il existe de nombreuses signatures indirectes accessibles aux etudes astrophysiques.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Cette these se concentre sur une de ces signatures la desintegration de ces particules peut donner des antiprotons que nous devrions voir dans les rayons cosmiques. La presente etude s'interesse a l'evaluation du bruit de fond correspondant a ce signal i.e. les antiprotons issus de l'interactions entre ce rayonnement cosmique noyaux et la matiere du milieu interstellaire. En particulier, la meconnaissance de ce bruit de fond etant principalement due aux incertitudes liees aux parametres de diffusion, la majeure partie de cette these porte sur la propagation des noyaux.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Le premier tiers de la these introduit la propagation des rayons cosmiques dans notre galaxie en insistant sur les processus nucleaires responsables de la fragmentation des noyaux. Dans le second tiers les differents modeles de propagation sont passes en revue et en particulier les liens entre le modele du Leaky Box et le modele de diffusion sont rappeles : la reacceleration ainsi que la convection y sont aussi discutees. Ceci donne ensuite lieu a un discussion qualitative sur l'information que nous pouvons extraire de la propagation des noyaux. Dans le dernier tiers, nous presentons finalement les solutions detaillees du modele de diffusion a deux dimensions ainsi que les contraintes obtenues sur les parametres de propagation. L'application de ces parametres au calcul du spectre de fond d'antiprotons secondaires conclut le travail de these.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Le code de propagation realise pour les noyaux et les antiprotons sous la forme decrite dans cette these a fait ses preuves en tant qu'outil d'analyse. Son usage sera sans aucun doute d'une grande utilite pour l'experience {AMS} sur la station spatiale internationale en 2003.},
