  abstract = {We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy  clustering and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg2 of griz imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric-redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while "blind" to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat {$\Lambda$} CDM and w CDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for {$\Lambda$} CDM ) or 7 (for w CDM ) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 \texttimes 457 element analytic covariance matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point functions and from their combination obtain S8{$\equiv\sigma$}8({$\Omega$}m/0.3 )0.5=0.77 3-0.020+0.026 and {$\Omega$}m=0.26 7-0.017+0.030 for {$\Lambda$} CDM ; for w CDM , we find S8=0.78 2-0.024+0.036, {$\Omega$}m=0.28 4-0.030+0.033, and w =-0.8 2-0.20+0.21 at 68\% C.L. The precision of these DES Y1 constraints rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms. Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for S8 and {$\Omega$}m are lower than the central values from Planck for both {$\Lambda$} CDM and w CDM , the Bayes factor indicates that the DES Y1 and Planck data sets are consistent with each other in the context of {$\Lambda$} CDM . Combining DES Y1 with Planck, baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements from SDSS, 6dF, and BOSS and type Ia supernovae from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis data set, we derive very tight constraints on cosmological parameters: S8=0.802 {$\pm$}0.012 and {$\Omega$}m=0.298 {$\pm$}0.007 in {$\Lambda$} CDM and w =-1.0 0-0.04+0.05 in w CDM . Upcoming Dark Energy Survey analyses will provide more stringent tests of the {$\Lambda$} CDM model and extensions such as a time-varying equation of state of dark energy or modified gravity.},

  abstract = {Galaxy cluster counts in bins of mass and redshift have been shown to be a competitive probe to test cosmological models. This method requires an efficient blind detection of clusters from surveys with a well-known selection function and robust mass estimates, which is particularly challenging at high redshift. The \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} wide survey will cover 15 000 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} of the sky, avoiding contamination by light from our Galaxy and our solar system in the optical and near-infrared bands, down to magnitude 24 in the \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}-band. The resulting data will make it possible to detect a large number of galaxy clusters spanning a wide-range of masses up to redshift {$\sim$}2 and possibly higher. This paper presents the final results of the \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} Cluster Finder Challenge (CFC), fourth in a series of similar challenges. The objective of these challenges was to select the cluster detection algorithms that best meet the requirements of the \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} mission. The final CFC included six independent detection algorithms, based on different techniques, such as photometric redshift tomography, optimal filtering, hierarchical approach, wavelet and friend-of-friends algorithms. These algorithms were blindly applied to a mock galaxy catalog with representative \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$}-like properties. The relative performance of the algorithms was assessed by matching the resulting detections to known clusters in the simulations down to masses of \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{200{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\sim$} 10\textsuperscript{13.25{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}. Several matching procedures were tested, thus making it possible to estimate the associated systematic effects on completeness to {$<$} 3\%. All the tested algorithms are very competitive in terms of performance, with three of them reaching {$>$} 80\% completeness for a mean purity of 80\% down to masses of 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} and up to redshift \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 2. Based on these results, two algorithms were selected to be implemented in the \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} pipeline, the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) code, based on matched filtering, and the PZWav code, based on an adaptive wavelet approach.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The prototype of the NIKA2 camera, NIKA, is a dual-band instrument operating at the IRAM 30-m telescope, which can observe the sky simultaneously at 150 and 260 GHz. One of the main goals of NIKA (and NIKA2) is to measure the pressure distribution in galaxy clusters at high angular resolution using the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Such observations have already proved to be an excellent probe of cluster pressure distributions even at intermediate and high redshifts. However, an important fraction of clusters host sub-millimeter and/or radio point sources, which can significantly affect the reconstructed signal. Here we report on {$<$}20 arcsec angular resolution observations at 150 and 260 GHz of the cluster MACS J1423.8+2404, which hosts both radio and sub-millimeter point sources. We examine the morphological distribution of the tSZ signal and compare it to other datasets. The NIKA data are combined with \emph{Herschel {$<$}i/{$>$}satellite data to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the sub-millimeter point source contaminants. We then perform a joint reconstruction of the intracluster medium (ICM) electronic pressure and density by combining NIKA, \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$}, and \emph{Chandra {$<$}i/{$>$}data, focusing on the impact of the radio and sub-millimeter sources on the reconstructed pressureprofile. We find that large-scale pressure distribution is unaffected by the point sources because of the resolved nature of the NIKA observations. The reconstructed pressure in the inner region is slightly higher when the contribution of point sources are removed. We show that it is not possible to set strong constraints on the central pressure distribution without accurately removing these contaminants. The comparison with X-ray only data shows good agreement for the pressure, temperature, and entropy profiles, which all indicate that MACS J1423.8+2404 is a dynamically relaxed cool core system. The present observations illustrate the possibility of measuring these quantities with a relatively small integration time, even at high redshift and without X-ray spectroscopy. This work is part of a pilot study aiming at optimizing tSZ observations with the future NIKA2 camera.}}}}},

  abstract = {Measurement of the gas velocity distribution in galaxy clusters provides insight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form in the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be obtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is challenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic effects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report resolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple merger MACS J0717.5+3745 (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. Assuming that theSZ signal is the sum of a thermal (tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we extract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The kSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and + 3.4\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us and coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a major merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight velocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with X-ray observations from \emph{XMM-Newton {$<$}i/{$>$}and \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$}, we fit this model to constrain the gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the first time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our results are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and thanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the structure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination and systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter galaxies. Among the sources that we detect with NIKA, we find one which is likely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.}}}}},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}Millimetre-wave continuum astronomy is today an indispensable tool for both general astrophysics studies (e.g. star formation, nearby galaxies) and cosmology (e.g. cosmic microwave background and high-redshift galaxies). General purpose, large-field-of-view instruments are needed to map the sky at intermediate angular scales not accessible by the high-resolution interferometers (e.g. ALMA in Chile, NOEMA in the French Alps) and by the coarse angular resolution space-borne or ground-based surveys (e.g. \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}, ACT, SPT). These instruments have to be installed at the focal plane of the largest single-dish telescopes, which are placed at high altitude on selected dry observing sites. In this context, we have constructed and deployed a three-thousand-pixel dual-band (150 GHz and 260 GHz, respectively 2 mm and 1.15 mm wavelengths) camera to image an instantaneous circular field-of-view of 6.5 arcmin in diameter, and configurable to map the linear polarisation at 260 GHz.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}First, we are providing a detailed description of this instrument, named NIKA2 (New IRAM KID Arrays 2), in particular focussing on the cryogenics, optics, focal plane arrays based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors, and the readout electronics. The focal planes and part of the optics are cooled down to the nominal 150 mK operating temperature by means of an adhoc dilution refrigerator. Secondly, we are presenting the performance measured on the sky during the commissioning runs that took place between October 2015 and April 2017 at the 30-m IRAM telescope at Pico Veleta, near Granada (Spain).\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We have targeted a number of astronomical sources. Starting from beam-maps on primary and secondary calibrators we have then gone to extended sources and faint objects. Both internal (electronic) and on-the-sky calibrations are applied. The general methods are described in the present paper.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}NIKA2 has been successfully deployed and commissioned, performing in-line with expectations. In particular, NIKA2 exhibits full width at half maximum angular resolutions of around 11 and 17.5 arcsec at respectively 260 and 150 GHz. The noise equivalent flux densities are, at these two respective frequencies, 33{$\pm$}2 and 8{$\pm$}1 mJy s\textsuperscript{1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$}. A first successful science verification run was achieved in April 2017. The instrument is currently offered to the astronomy community and will remain available for at least the following ten years.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Context. In the currently debated context of using clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes, the need for well-defined cluster samples is critical. Aims: The XXL Survey has been specifically designed to provide a well characterised sample of some 500 X-ray detected clusters suitable for cosmological studies. The main goal of present article is to make public and describe the properties of the cluster catalogue in its present state, as well as of associated catalogues of more specific objects such as super-clusters and fossil groups. Methods: Following from the publication of the hundred brightest XXL clusters, we now release a sample containing 365 clusters in total, down to a flux of a few 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2 in the [0.5-2] keV band and in a 1' aperture. This release contains the complete subset of clusters for which the selection function is well determined plus all X-ray clusters which are, to date, spectroscopically confirmed. In this paper, we give the details of the follow-up observations and explain the procedure adopted to validate the cluster spectroscopic redshifts. Considering the whole XXL cluster sample, we have provided two types of selection, both complete in a particular sense: one based on flux-morphology criteria, and an alternative based on the [0.5-2] keV flux within 1 arcmin of the cluster centre. We have also provided X-ray temperature measurements for 80\% of the clusters having a flux larger than 9 \texttimes{} 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2. Results: Our cluster sample extends from z 0 to z 1.2, with one cluster at z 2. Clusters were identified through a mean number of six spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. The largest number of confirmed spectroscopic members in a cluster is 41. Our updated luminosity function and luminosity-temperature relation are compatible with our previous determinations based on the 100 brightest clusters, but show smaller uncertainties. We also present an enlarged list of super-clusters and a sample of 18 possible fossil groups.  Conclusions: This intermediate publication is the last before the final release of the complete XXL cluster catalogue when the ongoing C2 cluster spectroscopic follow-up is complete. It provides a unique inventory of medium-mass clusters over a 50 deg2 area out to z 1.

  abstract = {We present an analysis of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} satellite data on the Coma cluster observed via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Thanks to its great sensitivity, \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} is able, for the first time, to detect SZ emission up to \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. We test previously proposed spherically symmetric models for the pressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. In particular, we find that the Arnaud et al. (2010, A\&A, 517, A92) ``universal'' pressure profile does not fit Coma, and that their pressure profile for merging systems provides a reasonable fit to the data only at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}; by \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 2 \texttimes{} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} it underestimates the observed \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$} profile by a factor of {$\simeq$}2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either: i) the cluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of sight; or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} than the mean pressure profile predicted by the simulations used to constrain the models. The \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} image shows significant local steepening of the \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$} profile in two regions about half a degree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features are consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the western feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in the radio. Using \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}\emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$} profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find pressure jumps of 4.9\textsubscript{-0.2{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+0.4{$<$}sup/{$>$} and 5.0\textsubscript{-0.1{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+1.3{$<$}sup/{$>$} in the west and south-east, respectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce that the shock waves should propagate with Mach number \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{w{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 2.03\textsubscript{-0.04{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+0.09{$<$}sup/{$>$} and \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{se{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 2.05\textsubscript{-0.02{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+0.25{$<$}sup/{$>$} in the west and south-east, respectively. Finally, we find that the \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$} and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc scales, with small intrinsic scatter. This implies either that the energy density of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster, or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius than previously thought.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early 2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design, and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands centered at: 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes and one large-aperture 6-m telescope, with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization. The small aperture telescopes will target the largest angular scales observable from Chile, mapping {$\approx$} 10\% of the sky to a white noise level of 2 {$\mu$}K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, at a target level of {$\sigma$}(r)=0.003. The large aperture telescope will map {$\approx$} 40\% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected white noise level of 6 {$\mu$}K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, overlapping with the majority of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope sky region and partially with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000 extragalactic sources.},

  abstract = {We present new arcminute-resolution maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, using data taken from 2013\textendash 2016 at 98 and 150 GHz. The maps cover more than 17,000 deg2, the deepest 600 deg2 with noise levels below 10{$\mu$}K-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg2 of these maps to constrain cosmology. The ACT data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, H0. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure H0=67.6{$\pm$} 1.1 km/s/Mpc, at 68\% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find H0=67.9{$\pm$} 1.5 km/s/Mpc). The {$\Lambda$}CDM model provides a good fit to the ACT data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1{$\sigma$} the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with {$\Lambda$}CDM predictions to within 1.5\textendash 2.2{$\sigma$}. We compare ACT, WMAP, and Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the constraints on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters readjust when adding CMB large-scale information that ACT does not measure. The DR4 products presented here will be publicly released on the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis.},

  abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement errors. The first (BCES) is a direct extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It is quite general, allowing a) for measurement errors on both variables, b) the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, c) the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and d) other `symmetric' lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed. The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies only in the case where the `independent' variable is measured without error and the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the 'dependent' variable are independent from the measurements. Several applications are made to extragalactic astronomy: The BCES method, when applied to data describing the color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the estimators. Unsurprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example where the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity are correlated due to inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations, that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude. Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to ``reduce'' galaxies to a fiducial surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error.

Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis.

  abstract = {We present results of X-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selected via their imprint on the cosmic microwave background from the thermal Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. These clusters are a subset of the first SZ-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg2 of sky surveyed by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). Using X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton, we estimate the temperature, TX, and mass, Mg, of the intracluster medium within r500 for each cluster. From these, we calculate YX = MgTX and estimate the total cluster mass using an M500\textendash YX scaling relation measured from previous X-ray studies. The integrated Comptonization, YSZ, is derived from the SZ measurements, using additional information from the X-ray-measured gas density profiles and a universal temperature profile. We calculate scaling relations between the X-ray and SZ observables and find results generally consistent with other measurements and the expectations from simple self-similar behavior. Specifically, we fit a YSZ\textendash YX relation and find a normalization of 0.82 {$\pm$} 0.07, marginally consistent with the predicted ratio of YSZ/YX = 0.91 {$\pm$} 0.01 that would be expected from the density and temperature models used in this work. Using the YX-derived mass estimates, we fit a YSZ\textendash M500 relation and find a slope consistent with the self-similar expectation of YSZ{$\propto$}M5/3 with a normalization consistent with predictions from other X-ray studies. We find that the SZ mass estimates, derived from cosmological simulations of the SPT survey, are lower by a factor of 0.78 {$\pm$} 0.06 relative to the X-ray mass estimates. This offset is at a level of 1.3{$\sigma$} when considering the {$\sim$}15\% systematic uncertainty for the simulation-based SZ masses. Overall, the X-ray measurements confirm that the scaling relations of the SZ-selected clusters are consistent with the properties of other X-ray-selected samples of massive clusters, even allowing for the broad redshift range (0.29 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.08) of the sample.},

These methods have to tackle some of the awkward features prevalent in astronomical data, namely heteroscedastic (point-dependent) errors, intrinsic scatter, non-ignorable data collection and selection effects, data structure and non-uniform population (often called Malmquist bias), non-Gaussian data, outliers, and mixtures of regressions. We outline how least square fits, weighted least squares methods, Maximum Likelihood, survival analysis, and Bayesian methods have been applied in the astrophysics literature when one or more of these features is present.

  abstract = {This work attains a threefold objective: first, we derived the richness-mass scaling in the local Universe from data of 53 clusters with individual measurements of mass. We found a 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.12 slope and a 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.03 dex scatter measuring richness with a previously developed method. Second, we showed on a real sample of 250 0.06 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.9 clusters, most of which are at z \&lt; 0.3, with spectroscopic redshift that the colour of the red sequence allows us to measure the clusters' redshift to better than {$\increment$}z = 0.02. Third, we computed the predicted prior of the richness-mass scaling to forecast the capabilities of future wide-field-area surveys of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmological parameters. To this aim, we generated a simulated universe obeying the richness-mass scaling that we found. We observed it with a PanStarrs 1+Euclid-like survey, allowing for intrinsic scatter between mass and richness, for errors on mass, on richness, and for photometric redshift errors. We fitted the observations with an evolving five-parameter richness-mass scaling with parameters to be determined. Input parameters were recovered, but only if the cluster mass function and the weak-lensing redshift-dependent selection function were accounted for in the fitting of the mass-richness scaling. This emphasizes the limitations of often adopted simplifying assumptions, such as having a mass-complete redshift-independent sample. We derived the uncertainty and the covariance matrix of the (evolving) richness-mass scaling, which are the input ingredients of cosmological forecasts using cluster counts. We find that the richness-mass scaling parameters can be determined 10\textsuperscript{5} times better than estimated in previous works that did not use weak-lensing mass estimates, although we emphasize that this high factor was derived with scaling relations with different parameterizations. The better knowledge of the scaling parameters likely has a strong impact on the relative importance of the different probes used to constrain cosmological parameters. The fitting code used for computing the predicted prior, including the treatment of the mass function and of the weak-lensing selection function, is provided in Appendix A. It can be re-used, for example, to derive the predicted prior of other observable-mass scalings, such as the L\textsubscript{X}-mass relation. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$} {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles with REXCESS, a representative sample of 33 local (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.2) clusters drawn from the REFLEX catalogue and observed with \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$}. The sample spans a mass range of 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 10\textsuperscript{15{$<$}sup/{$>$} , where \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} is the mass corresponding to a density contrast of 500. We derive an average profile from observations scaled by mass and redshift according to the standard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean is remarkably low, at less than 30 per cent beyond 0.2 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, but increases towards the center. Deviations about the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state of the cluster. Morphologically disturbed systems have systematically shallower profiles while cooling core systems are more concentrated. The scaled profiles exhibit a residual mass dependence with a slope of \textasciitilde 0.12, consistent with that expected from the empirically-derived slope of the \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} \textendash{} \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation; however, the departure from standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero at \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. The scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling is smaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure is the quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics. Comparison with scaled data from several state of the art numerical simulations shows good agreement outside the core. Combining the observational data in the radial range [0.03\textendash 1] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} with simulation data in the radial range [1\textendash 4] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, we derive a robust measure of the universal pressure profile, that, in an analytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as a function of mass and redshift up to the cluster ``boundary''. Using this profile and direct spherical integration of the observed pressure profiles, we estimate the integrated Compton parameter \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$} and investigate its scaling with \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$}, the soft band X-ray luminosity. We consider both the spherically integrated quantity, \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{sph{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}), proportional to the gas thermal energy, and the cylindrically integrated quantity, \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cyl{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$})=\emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{SZ{$<$}sub/{$>$} \emph{D{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{A{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}, which is directly related to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal. From the low scatter of the observed \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{sph{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) \textendash{} \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation we show that variations in pressure profile shape do not introduce extra scatter into the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{sph{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) \textendash{} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation as compared to that from the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} \textendash{} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation.

We quantify the impact of uncertainties in HMF parameters on cosmological constraints from cluster catalogs similar to those from Planck, those expected from the Euclid, Roman, and Rubin surveys, and from a hypothetical larger future survey. We analyze simulated catalogs in each case, gradually loosening priors on HMF parameters to evaluate the degradation in cosmological constraints. While current uncertainties on HMF parameters do not substantially impact Planck-like surveys, we find that they can significantly degrade the cosmological constraints for a Euclid-like survey. Consequently, the current precision on the HMF is not sufficient for Euclid, Roman, Rubin or possible larger surveys. Future experiments will have to properly account for uncertainties in HMF parameters, and it will be necessary to improve the precision of HMF fits to avoid weakening constraints on cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and a recent reanalysis of Type Ia supernova (SN) data. In particular, we take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest (LyaF) in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Treating the BAO scale as an uncalibrated standard ruler, BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy; in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Adding the CMB-calibrated physical scale of the sound horizon, the combination of BAO and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a measurement of H0=67.3 {$\pm$}1.1 km s-1 Mpc-1 , with 1.7\% precision. This measurement assumes standard prerecombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat {$\Lambda$} CDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For constant dark energy ({$\Lambda$} ), our BAO +SN +CMB combination yields matter density {$\Omega$}m=0.301 {$\pm$}0.008 and curvature {$\Omega$}k=-0.003 {$\pm$}0.003 . When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO +SN +CMB parameter constraints are always consistent with flat {$\Lambda$} CDM values at {$\approx$}1 {$\sigma$} . While the overall {$\chi$}2 of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2 - 2.5 {$\sigma$} ) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshift remain consistent with our expansion history constraints, and they yield a higher H0 and lower matter clustering amplitude, improving agreement with some low redshift observations. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit on the summed mass of neutrino species, {$\sum$}m{$\nu<$}0.56 eV (95\% confidence), improving to {$\sum$}m{$\nu<$}0.25 eV if we include the lensing signal in the Planck CMB power spectrum. In a flat {$\Lambda$} CDM model that allows extra relativistic species, our data combination yields Neff=3.43 {$\pm$}0.26 ; while the LyaF BAO data prefer higher Neff when excluding galaxy BAO, the galaxy BAO alone favor Neff{$\approx$}3 . When structure growth is extrapolated forward from the CMB to low redshift, standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.},

A description of the control system is given together with measured performance data. The additional cost of the thermal control amounts to 10 percent of the total cost of the telescope. The increase in availability with unimpaired characteristics is estimated at a factor of 1.5-2. Calculations with a detailed thermal model are also in accordance with the measurements. Thus temperature effects can be included numerically in the structural design and be controlled to eliminate thermally induced deformations.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on extensions to the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmological  model from measurements of the \$E\$-mode polarization auto-power spectrum and the temperature-\$E\$-mode cross-power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) made using 2018 SPT-3G data. The extensions considered vary the primordial helium abundance, the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, the sum of neutrino masses, the relativistic energy density and mass of a sterile neutrino, and the mean spatial curvature. We do not find clear evidence for any of these extensions, from either the SPT-3G 2018 dataset alone or in combination with baryon acoustic oscillation and \textbackslash textit\{Planck\} data. None of these model extensions significantly relax the tension between Hubble-constant, \$H\_0\$, constraints from the CMB and from distance-ladder measurements using Cepheids and supernovae. The addition of the SPT-3G 2018 data to \textbackslash textit\{Planck\} reduces the square-root of the determinants of the parameter covariance matrices by factors of \$1.3 - 2.0\$ across these models, signaling a substantial reduction in the allowed parameter volume. We also explore CMB-based constraints on \$H\_0\$ from combined SPT, \textbackslash textit\{Planck\}, and ACT DR4 datasets. While individual experiments see some indications of different \$H\_0\$ values between the \$TT\$, \$TE\$, and \$EE\$ spectra, the combined \$H\_0\$ constraints are consistent between the three spectra. For the full combined datasets, we report \$H\_0 = 67.49 \textbackslash pm 0.53\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{km\textbackslash,s\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$, which is the tightest constraint on \$H\_0\$ from CMB power spectra to date and in \$4.1\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$ tension with the most precise distance-ladder-based measurement of \$H\_0\$. The SPT-3G survey is planned to continue through at least 2023, with existing maps of combined 2019 and 2020 data already having \$\textbackslash sim3.5\textbackslash times\$ lower noise than the maps used in this analysis.},

  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, {$\hslash\omega$}. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average ({$\hslash\omega$})2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0\textdegree K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

  abstract = {Surveys in the next decade will deliver large samples of galaxy clusters that transform our understanding of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and cosmology studies will become systematics limited with samples of this magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this is only realized if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way. Here we introduce the MOCK-X analysis framework, a multiwavelength tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological simulations and derives halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating optical, Compton-y and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image analysis method, we demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring hydrostatic mass bias for the IllustrisTNG, BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations. Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant bias b {$\asymp$} 0.13 with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or subgrid physics. However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic observations is mass-dependent, increasing to b = 0.3 for the most massive clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure equilibrium. The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence. The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current observations and future surveys will contain sufficient samples of massive clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic bias.},

  abstract = {We report new galaxy clusters previously unknown included in the first  Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources catalogue, the PSZ1. The results presented here were achieved during the second year of a two-year observational programme, the ITP13, developed at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). Using the 2.5 m Isaac Newton telescope, the 3.5 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, the 4.2 m William Herschel telescope and the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias we characterised 75 SZ sources with low SZ significance, SZ S/N {$<$} 5.32. We performed deep optical imaging and spectroscopy in order to associate actual galaxy clusters with the SZ Planck source. We adopted robust criteria, based on the 2D spatial distribution, richness, and velocity dispersions to confirm actual optical counterparts up to z {$<$} 0.85. The selected systems are confirmed only if they are well aligned with respect to the PSZ1 coordinate and show high richness and high velocity dispersion. In addition, we also inspected the Compton y-maps and SZ significance in order to identify unrealistic detections. Following this procedure, we identify 26 cluster counterparts associated with the SZ emission, which means that only about 35\% of the clusters considered in this low S/N PSZ1 subsample are validated. Forty-nine SZ sources ({$\sim$}65\% of this PSZ1 subset) remain unconfirmed. At the end of the ITP13 observational programme, we have studied 256 SZ sources with Dec {$\geq$} -15\textdegree{} (212 of them completely unknown), finding optical counterparts for 152 SZ sources. The ITP13 validation programme has allowed us to update the PSZ1 purity, which is now more refined, increasing from 72\% to 83\% in the low SZ S/N regime. Our results are consistent with the predicted purity curve for the full PSZ1 catalogue and with the expected fraction of false detections caused by the non-Gaussian noise of foreground signals. We find a strong correlation between the number of unconfirmed sources and the thermal emission of diffuse galactic dust at 857 GHz, thus increasing the fraction of false Planck SZ detections at low galactic latitudes.},

Here we present a pilot X-ray study of the five most massive (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}\emph{ {$>$} {$<$}i/{$>$} 5 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$}\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}), distant (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 1), clusters detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich effect. We optimally combine \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$} X-ray observations by leveraging the throughput of \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} to obtain spatially-resolved spectroscopy, and the spatial resolution of \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$} to probe the bright inner parts and to detect embedded point sources. Capitalising on the excellent agreement in flux-related measurements, we present a new method to derive the density profiles, which are constrained in the centre by \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$} and in the outskirts by \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$}. We show that the \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$}-\emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} combination is fundamental for morphological analysis at these redshifts, the \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$} resolution being required to remove point source contamination, and the \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} sensitivity allowing higher significance detection of faint substructures. Measuring the morphology using images from both instruments, we found that the sample is dominated by dynamically disturbed objects. We use the combined \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$}-\emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} density profiles and spatially-resolved temperature profiles to investigate thermodynamic quantities including entropy and pressure. From comparison of the scaled profiles with the local REXCESS sample, we find no significant departure from standard self-similar evolution, within the dispersion, at any radius, except for the entropy beyond 0.7 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. The baryon mass fraction tends towards the cosmic value, with a weaker dependence on mass than that observed in the local Universe. We make a comparison with the predictions from numerical simulations. The present pilot study demonstrates the utility and feasibility of spatially-resolved analysis of individual objects at high-redshift through the combination of \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{Chandra{$<$}i/{$>$} observations. Observations of a larger sample will allow a fuller statistical analysis to be undertaken, in particular of the intrinsic scatter in the structural and scaling properties of the cluster population.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clusters resulting from fitting a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk, \& White model to the reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak-lensing (WL) observations. The reduced shear profiles are generated for {$\approx$}104 cluster-sized halos formed in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 h -1 Gpc box. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the WL masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections along the line of sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is {$\approx$}20\% for massive clusters and can be as high as {$\approx$}30\% for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that WL mass measurements can have a small, {$\approx$}5\%-10\%, but non-negligible amount of bias. Given that WL measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to calibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmological constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias requires detailed simulations that include more observational effects than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each specific WL mass estimation method, as the details of the method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method for estimating mass M 500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.},

This work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at high significance in the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, which was completed in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of {$\xi$} = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76\%) of the {$\xi$} {$>$} 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95\%) of the {$\xi$} {$>$} 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z {$\sim$} 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c({$\rho$}crit) , the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z {$>$} 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We derive cosmological constraints using a galaxy cluster sample selected from the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey. The sample spans the redshift range 0.25 5. The sample is supplemented with optical weak gravitational lensing measurements of 32 clusters with 0.29 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.13 (from Magellan and Hubble Space Telescope) and X-ray measurements of 89 clusters with 0.25 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.75 (from Chandra). We rely on minimal modeling assumptions: (i) weak lensing provides an accurate means of measuring halo masses, (ii) the mean SZ and X-ray observables are related to the true halo mass through power-law relations in mass and dimensionless Hubble parameter E(z) with a priori unknown parameters, and (iii) there is (correlated, lognormal) intrinsic scatter and measurement noise relating these observables to their mean relations. We simultaneously fit for these astrophysical modeling parameters and for cosmology. Assuming a flat {$\nu\Lambda$}CDM model, in which the sum of neutrino masses is a free parameter, we measure {$\Omega$}m = 0.276 {$\pm$} 0.047, {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.781 {$\pm$} 0.037, and {$\sigma$} 8({$\Omega$}m/0.3)0.2 = 0.766 {$\pm$}0.025. The redshift evolutions of the X-ray Y X\textendash mass and M gas\textendash mass relations are both consistent with self-similar evolution to within 1{$\sigma$}. The mass slope of the Y X\textendash mass relation shows a 2.3{$\sigma$} deviation from self-similarity. Similarly, the mass slope of the M gas\textendash mass relation is steeper than self-similarity at the 2.5{$\sigma$} level. In a {$\nu$}wCDM cosmology, we measure the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.55 {$\pm$} 0.41 from the cluster data. We perform a measurement of the growth of structure since redshift z {$\sim$} 1.7 and find no evidence for tension with the prediction from general relativity. This is the first analysis of the SPT cluster sample that uses direct weak-lensing mass calibration and is a step toward using the much larger weak-lensing data set from DES. We provide updated redshift and mass estimates for the SPT sample.},

The emulator is based on the recently completed Mira-Titan Universe suite of cosmological N-body simulations. The main set of simulations spans 111 cosmological models with 2.1 Gpc boxes.

We obtain smooth halo mass functions by fitting piecewise second-order polynomials to the halo catalogs and employ Gaussian process regression to construct the emulator while keeping track of the statistical noise in the input halo catalogs and uncertainties in the regression process.

  abstract = {In the construction of an X-ray-selected sample of galaxy clusters for  cosmological studies, we have assembled a sample of 495 X-ray sources found to show extended X-ray emission in the first processing of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The sample covers the celestial region with declination {$\delta>$}=0deg and Galactic latitude |bII|{$>$}=20deg and comprises sources with a count rate {$>$}=0.06 counts s-1 and a source extent likelihood of L{$>$}=7. In an optical follow-up identification program we find 378 (76\%) of these sources to be clusters of galaxies. It was necessary to reanalyze the sources in this sample with a new X-ray source characterization technique to provide more precise values for the X-ray flux and source extent than obtained from the standard processing. This new method, termed growth curve analysis (GCA), has the advantage over previous methods in its ability to be robust, to be easy to model and to integrate into simulations, to provide diagnostic plots for visual inspection, and to make extensive use of the X-ray data. The source parameters obtained assist the source identification and provide more precise X-ray fluxes. This reanalysis is based on data from the more recent second processing of the ROSAT Survey. We present a catalog of the cluster sources with the X-ray properties obtained as well as a list of the previously flagged extended sources that are found to have a noncluster counterpart. We discuss the process of source identification from the combination of optical and X-ray data. To investigate the overall completeness of the cluster sample as a function of the X-ray flux limit, we extend the search for X-ray cluster sources to the data of the second processing of the ROSAT Survey for the northern sky region between 9h and 14h in right ascension. We include the search for X-ray emission of known clusters as well as a new investigation of extended X-ray sources. In the course of this search we find X-ray emission from 85 additional Abell clusters and 56 very probable cluster candidates among the newly found extended sources. A comparison of the X-ray cluster number counts of the NORAS sample with the ROSAT-ESO Flux-limited X-Ray (REFLEX) Cluster Survey results leads to an estimate of the completeness of the NORAS sample of ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) I extended clusters of about 50\% at an X-ray flux of FX(0.1-2.4 keV)=3\texttimes 10-12 ergs s-1 cm-2. The estimated completeness achieved by adding the supplementary sample in the study area amounts to about 82\% in comparison to REFLEX. The low completeness introduces an uncertainty in the use of the sample for cosmological statistical studies that will be cured with the completion of the continuing Northern ROSAT All-Sky (NORAS) Cluster Survey project. Results reported here are based on observations made with the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

  abstract = {For precision cosmological studies it is important to know the local properties of the reference point from which we observe the Universe. Particularly for the determination of the Hubble constant with low-redshift distance indicators, the values observed depend on the average matter density within the distance range covered. In this study we used the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution in the local Universe. The study is based on our CLASSIX galaxy cluster survey, which is highly complete and well characterised, where galaxy clusters are detected by their X-ray emission. In total, 1653 galaxy clusters outside the ``zone of avoidance'' fulfil the selection criteria and are involved in this study. We find a local underdensity in the cluster distribution of about 30\textendash 60\% which extends about 85 Mpc to the north and {$\sim$}170 Mpc to the south. We study the density distribution as a function of redshift in detail in several regions in the sky. For three regions for which the galaxy density distribution has previously been studied, we find good agreement between the density distribution of clusters and galaxies. Correcting for the bias in the cluster distribution we infer an underdensity in the matter distribution of about -30 {$\pm$} 15\% (-20 {$\pm$} 10\%) in a region with a radius of about 100 ({$\sim$}140) Mpc. Calculating the probability of finding such an underdensity through structure formation theory in a {$\Lambda$}CDM universe with concordance cosmological parameters, we find a probability characterised by \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}-values of 1.3 - 3.7. This indicates low probabilities, but with values of around 10\% at the lower uncertainty limit, the existence of an underdensity cannot be ruled out. Inside this underdensity, the observed Hubble parameter will be larger by about , which explains part of the discrepancy between the locally measured value of \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} compared to the value of the Hubble parameter inferred from the Planck observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. If distance indicators outside the local underdensity are included, as in many modern analyses, this effect is diluted.}}}},

  abstract = {We present the catalogue of the REFLEX Cluster Survey providing  information on the X-ray properties, redshifts, and some identification details of the clusters in the REFLEX sample. The catalogue describes a statistically complete X-ray flux-limited sample of 447 galaxy clusters above an X-ray flux of 3 \texttimes{} 10-12 erg s-1 cm-2 (0.1 to 2.4 keV) in an area of 4.24 ster in the southern sky. The cluster candidates were first selected by their X-ray emission in the ROSAT-All Sky Survey and subsequently spectroscopically identified in the frame of an ESO key programme. Previously described tests have shown that the sample is more than 90\% complete and there is a conservative upper limit of 9\% on the fraction of clusters with a dominant X-ray contamination from AGN. In addition to the cluster catalogue we also describe the complete selection criteria as a function of the sky position and the conversion functions used to analyse the X-ray data. These are essential for the precise statistical analysis of the large-scale cluster distribution. This data set is at present the largest, statistically complete X-ray galaxy cluster sample. Together with these data set we also provide for the first time the full three-dimensional selection function. The sample forms the basis of several cosmological studies, one of the most important applications being the assessment of the statistics of the large-scale structure of the universe and the test of cosmological models.

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters, the largest clearly defined objects in our Universe, are ideal laboratories to study in detail the cosmic evolution of the intergalactic intracluster medium (ICM) and the cluster galaxy population. For the ICM, which is heated to X-ray radiating temperatures, X-ray spectroscopy is the most important tool to obtain insight into the structure and astrophysics of galaxy clusters. The ICM is also the hottest plasma that can be well studied under thermal equilibrium conditions. In this review we recall the basic principles of the interpretation of X-ray spectra from a hot, tenuous plasma and we illustrate the wide range of scientific applications of X-ray spectroscopy. The determination of galaxy cluster masses, the most important prerequisite for using clusters in cosmological studies, rest crucially on a precise spectroscopic determination of the ICM temperature distribution. The study of the thermal structure of the ICM provides a very interesting fossil record of the energy release during galaxy formation and evolution, giving important constraints on galaxy formation models. The temperature and pressure distribution of the ICM gives us important insight into the process of galaxy cluster merging and the dissipation of the merger energy in form of turbulent motion. Cooling cores in the centers of about half of the cluster population are interesting laboratories to investigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation and energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy. The element abundances deduced from X-ray spectra of the ICM provide a cosmic history record of the contribution of different supernovae to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements and their spatial distribution partly reflects important transport processes in the ICM. Some discussion of plasma diagnostics for conditions out of thermal equilibrium and an outlook on the future prospects of X-ray spectroscopic cluster studies complete our review.},

X-ray observations of these largest clearly defined objects in our Universe have been by far the most fruitful approach that has provided us with rich astrophysical and cosmological insights. ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra observatories have been the powerhorses of this research. In this article we therefore like to summarize the major advances made in the field of galaxy cluster research primarily by these two instruments. We will touch the progress in understanding the structure of galaxy clusters and its statistics, the AGN feedback processes in the center of clusters, cosmic evolution of clusters, cluster mass measurements, the thermodynamic structure of the intracluster medium and its chemistry, X-ray surveys of clusters, and the use of galaxy clusters for cosmological tests.},

  abstract = {In the period 2012 June-2013 October, the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) went through the technical commissioning phase. The characterization involved three first-light receivers, ranging in frequency between 300MHz and 26GHz, connected to a Total Power back-end. It also tested and employed the telescope active surface installed in the main reflector of the antenna. The instrument status and performance proved to be in good agreement with the expectations in terms of surface panels alignment (at present 300{$\mu$}mrms to be improved with microwave holography), gain ({$\sim$}0.6K/Jy in the given frequency range), pointing accuracy (5 arcsec at 22GHz) and overall single-dish operational capabilities. Unresolved issues include the commissioning of the receiver centered at 350MHz, which was compromised by several radio frequency interferences, and a lower-than-expected aperture efficiency for the 22-GHz receiver when pointing at low elevations. Nevertheless, the SRT, at present completing its Astronomical Validation phase, is positively approaching its opening to the scientific community.},

  abstract = {We consistently include the effect of massive neutrinos in the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ) power spectrum and cluster counts analyses, highlighting subtle dependencies on the total neutrino mass and data combination. In particular, we find that using the transfer functions for cold dark matter (CDM) + baryons in the computation of the halo mass function, instead of the transfer functions including neutrino perturbations, as prescribed in recent work, yields an {$\asymp$}0.25 per cent downward shift of the {$\sigma$}8 constraint from tSZ power spectrum data, with a fiducial neutrino mass {$\Sigma$}m{$\nu$} = 0.06 eV. In {$\Lambda$}CDM, with an X-ray mass bias corresponding to the expected hydrostatic mass bias, i.e. (1 - b) {$\simeq$} 0.8, our constraints from Planck SZ data are consistent with the latest results from SPT, DES-Y1, and KiDS+VIKING-450. In {$\nu\Lambda$}CDM, our joint analyses of Planck SZ with Planck 2015 primary CMB yield a small improvement on the total neutrino mass bound compared to the Planck 2015 primary CMB constraint, as well as (1 - b) = 0.64 {$\pm$} 0.04 (68 per cent CL). For forecasts, we find that competitive neutrino mass measurements using cosmic variance limited SZ power spectrum require masking the heaviest clusters and probing the small-scale SZ power spectrum up to {$\mathscr{l}$}max {$\asymp$} 104. Although this is challenging, we find that SZ power spectrum can realistically be used to tightly constrain intracluster medium properties: we forecast a 2 per cent determination of the X-ray mass bias by combining CMB-S4 and our mock SZ power spectrum with {$\mathscr{l}$}max = 103.},

  abstract = {The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) provides a unique way to map the large-scale structure of the universe as traced by massive clusters of galaxies. As a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, the SZE is insensitive to the redshift of the galaxy cluster, making it well-suited for studies of clusters at all redshifts, and especially at reasonably high redshifts (z {$>$} 1) where the abundance of clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology. Recent high signal-to-noise detections of the SZE have enabled interesting constraints on the Hubble constant and the matter density of the universe using small samples of galaxy clusters. Upcoming SZE surveys are expected to find hundreds to thousands of new galaxy clusters, with a mass selection function that is remarkably uniform with redshift. In this review we provide an overview of the SZE and its use for cosmological studies with emphasis on the cosmology that can, in principle, be extracted from SZE survey yields. We discuss the observational and theoretical challenges that must be met before precise cosmological constraints can be extracted from the survey yields.},

A simple evolutionary model is found for the spectral luminosity function which is consistent with these data, as well as the magnitude distribution of galaxies optically identified with faint sources, and with in addition evolves all sources in the same way. This last feature renders the model consistent with physical mechanisms of evolution which do not distinguish between low luminosity and high luminosity sources. The model suggests that the question as to whether the mean spectral index of steep spectrum sources correlates with luminosity or redshift may be decidable on the basis of the spectral index distributions of faint sources, even if no redshifts are available for them.},

The SPT follow-up data, calibrating the richness-mass relation of the optically selected redMaPPer catalog, enable the cosmological exploitation of the DES cluster abundance data. To explore possible systematics related to the modeling of projection effects, we consider two calibrations of the observational scatter on richness estimates: a simple Gaussian model which account only for the background contamination (BKG), and a model which further includes contamination and incompleteness due to projection effects (PRJ). Assuming either a {$\Lambda$} CDM +{$\sum$}m{$\nu$} or w CDM +{$\sum$}m{$\nu$} cosmology, and for both scatter models, we derive cosmological constraints consistent with multiple cosmological probes of the low and high redshift Universe, and in particular with the SPT cluster abundance data. This result demonstrates that the DES Y1 and SPT cluster counts provide consistent cosmological constraints, if the same mass calibration data set is adopted. It thus supports the conclusion of the DES Y1 cluster cosmology analysis which interprets the tension observed with other cosmological probes in terms of systematics affecting the stacked weak lensing analysis of optically selected low-richness clusters. Finally, we analyze the first combined optically SZ selected cluster catalog obtained by including the SPT sample above the maximum redshift probed by the DES Y1 redMaPPer sample (z =0.65 ). Besides providing a mild improvement of the cosmological constraints, this data combination serves as a stricter test of our scatter models: the PRJ model, providing scaling relations consistent between the two abundance and multiwavelength follow-up data, is favored over the BKG model.},

The agreement in gas scaling relations down to \$10\^\{13\}\{\{\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm \{M\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\}\}\}\}\$ between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations.

  abstract = {Big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the first seconds of cosmic time. A brief overview of the essentials of this physics is given, and new calculations presented of light-element abundances through 6Li and 7Li, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. Fits are provided for these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors N{$\nu$}. Recent developments are reviewed in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff. These measurements allow for a tight test of BBN and cosmology using CMB data alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of BBN. A new determination of the primordial helium abundance is included in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions and are consistent with the standard model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of N{$\nu$} when combined with the CMB baryon density and provides a 2 {$\sigma$} upper limit N{$\nu<$}3.2 . The new precision of the CMB and D/H observations together leaves D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross-section data. In contrast with D/H and 4He, 7Li predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics. This paper concludes with a look at future directions including key nuclear reactions, astronomical observations, and theoretical issues.},

  abstract = {Cryogenic detectors are extremely sensitive and have a wide variety of applications (particularly in astronomy), but are difficult to integrate into large arrays like a modern CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. As current detectors of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) already have sensitivities comparable to the noise arising from the random arrival of CMB photons, the further gains in sensitivity needed to probe the very early Universe will have to arise from large arrays. A similar situation is encountered at other wavelengths. Single-pixel X-ray detectors now have a resolving power of {$\Delta$}E {$<$} 5eV for single 6-keV photons, and future X-ray astronomy missions anticipate the need for 1,000-pixel arrays. Here we report the demonstration of a superconducting detector that is easily fabricated and can readily be incorporated into such an array. Its sensitivity is already within an order of magnitude of that needed for CMB observations, and its energy resolution is similarly close to the targets required for future X-ray astronomy missions.}

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints obtained from galaxy clusters identified by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signature in the 2500 square-degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. We consider the 377 cluster candidates identified at z\textbackslash gt 0.25 with a detection significance greater than five, corresponding to the 95\% purity threshold for the survey. We compute constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling relations. Assuming a spatially flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H \textsubscript{0} and find \{{$\sigma$} \}\textsubscript{8}=0.784+/- 0.039 and \{\{\{{$\Omega$} \}\}\}\textsubscript{m}=0.289+/- 0.042, with the parameter combination \{{$\sigma$} \}\textsubscript{8}\{(\{\{\{{$\Omega$} \}\}\}\vphantom\}\textsubscript{m}/0.27)\vphantom\{\}\textsuperscript{0.3}=0.797+/- 0.031. These results are in good agreement with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from SPT, WMAP, and Planck, as well as with constraints from other cluster data sets. We also consider several extensions to {$\Lambda$}CDM, including models in which the equation of state of dark energy w, the species-summed neutrino mass, and/or the effective number of relativistic species (\{N\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}) are free parameters. When combined with constraints from the Planck CMB, H \textsubscript{0}, baryon acoustic oscillation, and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data improves the w constraint by 14\%, to w=-1.023+/- 0.042.},

In previous analyses, simplifying assumptions have been made in order to ease this intractability, but assumptions of this nature are unfortunate and restrictive. In this paper, we analyse errors-in-variables models in full generality under a Bayesian formulation. In order to compute the necessary posterior distributions, we utilize various computational techniques. Two specific non-linear errors-in-variables regression examples are considered; the first is a re-analysed Berkson-type model, and the second is a classical errors-in-variables model. Our analyses are compared and contrasted with those presented else-where in the literature.},

Using the X-ray data, we derive total mass profiles under the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. The central regions of RXC J0216.7-4749 are found to be dominated by an X-ray bright AGN, and although we derive a mass profile, uncertainties are large and the constraints are significantly weakened due to the presence of the central source. The total mass profile of RXC J2315.7-0222 is of high quality, being measured in fifteen bins from [0.075\textendash 0.75] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} and containing three data points interior to 30 kpc, allowing comprehensive investigation of its properties. We investigate several mass models based on the standard NFW profile or on the S\'ersic-like model recently suggested by high-resolution \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body simulations. We find that the addition of a stellar component due to the presence of the central galaxy is necessary for a good analytical model fit. In all mass profile models fitted, the mass concentration is not especially high compared to non-fossil systems. In addition, the modification of the dark matter halo by adiabatic contraction slightly improves the fit. However, our result depends critically on the choice of IMF used to convert galaxy luminosity to mass, which leads to a degeneracy between the central slope of the dark matter profile and the normalisation of the stellar component. While we argue on the basis of the range of /\emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} ratios that lower /\emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} ratios are preferred on physical grounds and that adiabatic contraction has thus operated in this system, better theoretical and observational convergence on this problem is needed to make further progess.}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We perform a joint analysis of the counts and weak lensing signal of redMaPPer clusters selected from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 dataset. Our analysis uses the same shear and source photometric redshifts estimates as were used in the DES combined probes analysis. Our analysis results in surprisingly low values for S8={$\sigma$}8({$\Omega$}m/0.3)0.5=0.65{$\pm$}0.04, driven by a low matter density parameter, {$\Omega$}m=0.179+0.031-0.038, with {$\sigma$}8-{$\Omega$}m posteriors in 2.4{$\sigma$} tension with the DES Y1 3x2pt results, and in 5.6{$\sigma$} with the Planck CMB analysis. These results include the impact of post-unblinding changes to the analysis, which did not improve the level of consistency with other data sets compared to the results obtained at the unblinding. The fact that multiple cosmological probes (supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and CMB anisotropies), and other galaxy cluster analyses all favor significantly higher matter densities suggests the presence of systematic errors in the data or an incomplete modeling of the relevant physics. Cross checks with x-ray and microwave data, as well as independent constraints on the observable-mass relation from Sunyaev-Zeldovich selected clusters, suggest that the discrepancy resides in our modeling of the weak lensing signal rather than the cluster abundance. Repeating our analysis using a higher richness threshold ({$\lambda\geq$}30) significantly reduces the tension with other probes, and points to one or more richness-dependent effects not captured by our model.},

By-products of the mission are shallow sensitivity maps over a large fraction of the sky (about 30\%) in the millimetre and submillimetre range at 143, 217, 353 and 545 GHz. From these maps, we produce a catalog of bright submillimetre point sources.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present in this paper the processing and analysis of the Archeops point sources. Redundancy across detectors is the key factor allowing us to distinguish glitches from genuine point sources in the 20 independent maps.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We look at the properties of the most reliable point sources, totalling 304. Fluxes range from 1 to 10 000 Jy (at the frequencies covering 143 to 545 GHz). All sources are either planets (2) or of galactic origin. The longitude range is from 75 to 198 degrees. Some of the sources are associated with the well-known Lynds Nebulae and HII compact regions in the galactic plane. A large fraction of the sources have an IRAS counterpart. Except for Jupiter, Saturn, the Crab and Cas A, all sources show a dust-emission-like modified blackbody emission spectrum. Temperatures cover a range from 7 to 27 K. For the coldest sources (\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 10 K), a steep emissivity law is found with a surprising \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 3 to 4. An inverse relationship between \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} is observed. The number density of sources at 353 GHz with flux brighter than 100 Jy is of the order of 1 per degree of Galactic longitude. These sources will provide a strong check for the calibration of the Planck HFI focal plane geometry as a complement to planets. These very cold sources observed by Archeops should be prime targets for mapping observations by the Akari and Herschel space missions and ground-based observatories.}}}}}}}},

This additional information will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark universe at an even deeper level and, in case Stage IV surveys find hints for physics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our current view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime.

It is argued that many of the claims in the literature favouring such solutions are caused by a misunderstanding of how distance ladder measurements actually work and, in particular, by the inappropriate use of a distance ladder H0 prior. A dynamics-free inverse distance ladder shows that changes to late-time physics are strongly constrained observationally and cannot resolve the discrepancy between the SH0ES data and the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology inferred from Planck. We propose a statistically rigorous scheme to replace the use of H0 priors.},

  abstract = {Aims: We present a study of the statistical properties of three  velocity dispersion and mass estimators: biweight, gapper, and standard deviation for a small number of galaxies (Ngal {$\leq$} 75). Methods: Using a set of 73 numerically simulated galaxy clusters, we first characterised the statistical bias and the variance for each one of the three estimators (biweight, gapper, and standard deviation) in the determination of the velocity dispersion and the dynamical mass of the clusters through the {$\sigma$}-M relation. These results were used to define a new set of unbiased estimators that are able to correct for these statistical biases with a minimum increase in associated variance. We also used the same set of numerical simulations to characterise two other physical biases that affect the estimates: the effect of velocity segregation on the selection of cluster members, and the effect of using cluster members within different physical radii from the cluster centre.  Results: The standard deviation (and its unbiased counterpart) is the estimator with the lowest variance estimator after the biweight and gapper. The effect of velocity segregation in the selection of galaxies within the sub-sample of the most massive galaxies in the cluster introduces a bias of 2\% in the velocity dispersion estimate when it is calculated using a quarter of the most massive cluster members. We also find a dependence of the velocity dispersion estimate on the aperture radius as a fraction of R200. This is consistent with previous results in the literature. Conclusions: The proposed set of unbiased estimators effectively provides a correction of the velocity dispersion and mass estimates from the statistical and physical effects discussed above for small numbers of cluster members. When these new estimators are applied to a subset of simulated observations, they can retrieve bias-corrected values for the mean velocity dispersion and the mean mass; the standard deviation has the lowest variance. Although for a single galaxy cluster the statistical and physical effects discussed here are comparable to or slightly smaller than the bias introduced by interlopers, they are relevant when ensemble properties and scaling relations for large number of clusters are studied.},

This has been a popular interface for applications in astrophysics because it is often non-trivial to implement realistic physics within the modeling frameworks required by other libraries. Since emcee's release, other libraries have been developed with similar interfaces, such as dynesty (Speagle 2019).

  abstract = {Measurement of the distances to nearby galaxies have improved rapidly in recent decades. The ever-present challenge is to reduce systematic effects, especially as greater distances are probed, and the uncertainties become larger. In this paper, we combine several recent calibrations of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method. These calibrations are internally self-consistent at the 1\% level. New Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) data provide an additional consistency check, at a (lower) 5\% level of accuracy, a result of the well-documented Gaia angular covariance bias. The updated TRGB calibration applied to a distant sample of Type Ia supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project results in a value of the Hubble constant of Ho = 69.8 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.6 (stat) \$\textbackslash pm\$ 1.6 (sys) km/s/Mpc. No statistically significant difference is found between the value of Ho based on the TRGB and that determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The TRGB results are also consistent to within 2\$\textbackslash sigma\$ with the SHoES and Spitzer plus HST Key Project Cepheid calibrations. The TRGB results alone do not demand additional new physics beyond the standard Lambda-CDM cosmological model. They have the advantage of simplicity of the underlying physics (the core He flash) and small systematic uncertainties (from extinction, metallicity and crowding). Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of both the TRGB and Cepheids are reviewed, and prospects for addressing the current discrepancy with future Gaia, HST and JWST observations are discussed. Resolving this discrepancy is essential for ascertaining if the claimed tension in Ho between the locally-measured and the CMB-inferred value is physically motivated.},

However, a perennial problem has been the mapping of optical `richness' measurements onto total cluster mass3,9-12. Emitted at a conformal distance of 14 gigaparsecs, the cosmic microwave background acts as a backlight to all intervening mass in the Universe, and therefore has been gravitationally lensed13-15. Experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope16, South Pole Telescope17-19 and the Planck20 satellite have now detected gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background and produced large-area maps of the foreground deflecting structures. Here we present a calibration of cluster optical richness at the 10\% level by measuring the average cosmic microwave background lensing measured by Planck towards the positions of large numbers of optically selected clusters, detecting the deflection of photons by structures of total mass of order 1014 M{$\odot$}. Although mainly aimed at the study of larger-scale structures, the Planck estimate of the cosmic microwave background lensing field can be used to recover a nearly unbiased lensing signal for stacked clusters on arcminute scales15,21. This approach offers a clean measure of total cluster masses over most of cosmic history, largely independent of baryon physics.},

  abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties, e.g., density, temperature, pressure, and entropy, of the most massive and the most distant (seven clusters at z {$>$} 1.2) clusters selected by the South Pole Telescope and compare them with those of the nearby clusters (13 clusters at z {$<$} 0.1) to constrain their evolution as a function of time and radius. We find that thermodynamic properties in the outskirts of high-redshift clusters are remarkably similar to the low-redshift clusters, and their evolution follows the prediction of the self-similar model. Their intrinsic scatter is larger, indicating that the physical properties that lead to the formation and virialization of cluster outskirts show evolving variance. On the other hand, thermodynamic properties in the cluster cores deviate significantly from self-similarity, indicating that the processes that regulate the core are already in place in these very high redshift clusters. This result is supported by the unevolving physical scatter of all thermodynamic quantities in cluster cores.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are useful tools to constrain cosmological parameters, only if their masses can be correctly inferred from observations. In particular, X-ray and Sunyaev\textendash Zeldovich (SZ) effect observations can be used to derive masses within the framework of the hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good control of the possible mass biases that can be introduced when this hypothesis is not valid. In this work, we analysed a set of 260 synthetic clusters from the MUSIC simulation project at redshifts 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 0.82. We estimate the hydrostatic mass of the MUSIC clusters from X-ray only (temperature and density) and from X-ray and SZ (density and pressure). Then, we compare them with the true 3D dynamical mass. The biases are of the order of 20~per\,cent. We find that using the temperature instead of the pressure leads to a smaller bias, although the two values are compatible within 1{$\sigma$}. Non-thermal contributions to the total pressure support, arising from bulk motion and turbulence of the gas, are also computed and show that they are sufficient to account for this bias. We also present a study of the correlation between the mass bias and the dynamical state of the clusters. A clear correlation is shown between the relaxation state of the clusters and the bias factor. We applied the same analysis on a subsample of 32 objects, already selected for supporting the NIKA2 SZ Large Program.},

  abstract = {Context. The large-scale mass distribution around dark matter haloes  hosting galaxy clusters provides sensitive cosmological information. Aims. In this work, we make use of a large photometric galaxy cluster sample, constructed from the public Third Data Release of the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the corresponding shear signal, to assess cluster masses and test the concordance \$\{\textbackslash Lambda\}\$-cold dark matter (\$\{\textbackslash Lambda\}\$CDM) model. In particular, we study the weak gravitational lensing effects on scales beyond the cluster virial radius, where the signal is dominated by correlated and uncorrelated matter density distributions along the line-of-sight. The analysed catalogue consists of 6962 galaxy clusters, in the redshift range \$0.1 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 0.6\$ and with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3.5. Methods. We perform a full Bayesian analysis to model the stacked shear profiles of these clusters. The adopted likelihood function considers both the small-scale 1-halo term, used primarily to constrain the cluster structural properties, and the 2-halo term, that can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. Results. We find that the adopted modelling is successful to assess both the cluster masses and the total matter density parameter, \$\{\textbackslash Omega\}\_M\$, when fitting shear profiles up to the largest available scales of 35 Mpc/h. Moreover, our results provide a strong observational evidence of the 2-halo signal in the stacked gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters, further demonstrating the reliability of this probe for cosmological studies. The main result of this work is a robust constraint on \$\{\textbackslash Omega\}\_M\$, assuming a flat \$\{\textbackslash Lambda\}\$CDM cosmology. We get \$\{\textbackslash Omega\}\_M = 0.29 \textbackslash pm 0.02\$, estimated from the full posterior probability distribution, consistent with the estimates from cosmic microwave background experiments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we give a phenomenological treatment of supracon-ductivity based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and on the assumption that the magnetic induction inside a supraconductive body is zero. After a brief survey of new experiments on supraconductivity (\textsection{} 1) these ideas are applied to a body, which is entirely in the supraconductive state (\textsection{} 2). In \textsection{} 3 we consider the transition process for a needle parallel to a magnetic field and derive an equation connecting the jump of the specific heat and the derivative of the magnetic threshold value with respect to the temperature (Rutgers' equation). In \textsection{} 4 these considerations are extended to a more general system of supraconductive bodies; in this case there will be a continuous transition process. In \textsection{} 5 the disturbance of supraconductivity of a cylinder by a current flowing in the cylinder is considered in detail and Silsbee's hypothesis is confirmed. In \textsection{} 6 we discuss our results and the experimental evidence for our fundamental assumptions. Some questions, which remain as yet unsolved, are mentioned.}

  abstract = {Cosmological inference from cluster number counts is systematically limited by the accuracy of the mass calibration, i.e. the empirical determination of the mapping between cluster selection observables and halo mass. In this work we demonstrate a method to quantitatively determine the bias and uncertainties in weak-lensing mass calibration. To this end, we extract a library of projected matter density profiles from hydrodynamical simulations. Accounting for shear bias and noise, photometric redshift uncertainties, mis-centering, cluster member contamination, cluster morphological diversity, and line-of-sight projections, we produce a library of shear profiles. Fitting a one-parameter model to these profiles, we extract the so-called \textbackslash emph\{weak lensing mass\} \$M\_\textbackslash text\{WL\}\$. Relating the weak-lensing mass to the halo mass from gravity-only simulations with the same initial conditions as the hydrodynamical simulations allows us to estimate the impact of hydrodynamical effects on cluster number counts experiments. Creating new shear libraries for \$\textbackslash sim\$1000 different realizations of the systematics, provides a distribution of the parameters of the weak-lensing to halo mass relation, reflecting their systematic uncertainty. This result can be used as a prior for cosmological inference. We also discuss the impact of the inner fitting radius on the accuracy, and determine the outer fitting radius necessary to exclude the signal from neighboring structures. Our method is currently being applied to different Stage\textasciitilde III lensing surveys, and can easily be extended to Stage\textasciitilde IV lensing surveys.},

The SPIRE detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4\textasciiacute\texttimes{} 8\textasciiacute, observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6\textasciiacute. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the \emph{Herschel{$<$}i/{$>$} cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5\textendash 2.}}}}},

We derive the average spectral sequence of type Ia supernovae and their main variability components including a color variation law. The model allows us to measure distance moduli in the spectral range 2500-8000 \AA{} with calculable uncertainties, including those arising from variability of spectral features. Results: Thanks to the use of high-redshift SNe to model the rest-frame UV spectral energy distribution, we are able to derive improved distance estimates for SNe Ia in the redshift range 0.8},

  abstract = {We consider methods with which to answer the question ``is any observed galaxy cluster too unusual for {$\Lambda$}CDM?'' After emphasising that many previous attempts to answer this question will overestimate the confidence level at which {$\Lambda$}CDM can be ruled out, we outline a consistent approach to these rare clusters, which allows the question to be answered. We define three statistical measures, each of which are sensitive to changes in cluster populations arising from different modifications to the cosmological model. We also use these properties to define the ``equivalent mass at redshift zero'' for a cluster \textemdash{} the mass of an equally unusual cluster today. This quantity is independent of the observational survey in which the cluster was found, which makes it an ideal proxy for ranking the relative unusualness of clusters detected by different surveys. These methods are then used on a comprehensive sample of observed galaxy clusters and we confirm that all are less than 2{$\sigma$} deviations from the {$\Lambda$}CDM expectation. Whereas we have only applied our method to galaxy clusters, it is applicable to any isolated, collapsed, halo. As motivation for future surveys, we also calculate where in the mass redshift plane the rarest halo is most likely to be found, giving information as to which objects might be the most fruitful in the search for new physics.},

It is shown that if the density fluctuations at this epoch are proportional to N-n (where N is the number of particles in a disturbance), then n must exactly, or very closely, equal the value 23 in order that such fluctuations develop into protogalaxies. This result is independent of the value of the threshold epoch, and of the equation of state for the very early universe. Arguments of a speculative nature are then presented which indicate that the threshold epoch occurs at the Planck density. It is also proposed that the initial conditions of galaxy formation are metric fluctuations at the threshold epoch of classical cosmology. The evidence in favor of this theory is (i) the density fluctuation obeys the n=23 rule, and (ii) the spin fluctuation gives an eventual angular momentum of the order N43{$\hslash$}, in reasonable agrement with that of the Galaxy.}

  abstract = {The FIRST survey, begun over 20 years ago, provides the definitive high-resolution map of the radio sky. This Very Large Telescope (VLA) survey reaches a detection sensitivity of 1 mJy at 20 cm over a final footprint of 10,575 deg\textsuperscript{2} that is largely coincident with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) area. Both the images and a catalog containing 946,432 sources are available through the FIRST Web site ({$<$}A href="http://sundog.stsci.edu"{$>$}http://sundog.stsci.edu{$<$}/A{$>$}). We record here the authoritative survey history, including hardware and software changes that affect the catalog's reliability and completeness. In particular, we use recent observations taken with the JVLA to test various aspects of the survey data (astrometry, CLEAN bias, and the flux density scale). We describe a new, sophisticated algorithm for flagging potential sidelobes in this snapshot survey, and show that fewer than 10\% of the cataloged objects are likely sidelobes, and that these are heavily concentrated at low flux densities and in the vicinity of bright sources, as expected. We also report a comparison of the survey with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), as well as a match of the FIRST catalog to the SDSS and Two Micron Sky Survey (2MASS) sky surveys. The NVSS match shows very good consistency in flux density scale and astrometry between the two surveys. The matches with 2MASS and SDSS indicate a systematic \textasciitilde 10-20 mas astrometric error with respect to the optical reference frame in all VLA data that has disappeared with the advent of the JVLA. We demonstrate strikingly different behavior between the radio matches to stellar objects and to galaxies in the optical and IR surveys reflecting the different radio populations present over the flux density range 1-1000 mJy. As the radio flux density declines, stellar counterparts (quasars) get redder and fainter, while galaxies get brighter and have colors that initially redden but then turn bluer near the FIRST detection limit. Implications for future radio sky surveys are also briefly discussed. In particular, we show that for radio source identification at faint optical magnitudes, high angular resolution observations are essential, and cannot be sacrificed in exchange for high signal-to-noise data. The value of a JVLA survey as a complement to Square Kilometer Array precursor surveys is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing  observations from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), with redshift-space galaxy clustering observations from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and galaxy-galaxy lensing observations from the overlap between KiDS-1000, BOSS, and the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey. This combination of large-scale structure probes breaks the degeneracies between cosmological parameters for individual observables, resulting in a constraint on the structure growth parameter S8 = {$\sigma$}8{$\surd$}({$\Omega$}m/0.3) = 0.766-0.014+0.020, which has the same overall precision as that reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave background observations from Planck. The recovered S8 amplitude is low, however, by 8.3 {$\pm$} 2.6\% relative to Planck. This result builds from a series of KiDS-1000 analyses where we validate our methodology with variable depth mock galaxy surveys, our lensing calibration with image simulations and null-tests, and our optical-to-near-infrared redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues and a spectroscopic-photometric clustering analysis. The systematic uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded through as nuisance parameters in our cosmological analysis. Inspecting the offset between the marginalised posterior distributions, we find that the S8-difference with Planck is driven by a tension in the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter, {$\sigma$}8. We quantify the level of agreement between the cosmic microwave background and our large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding differences with a significance ranging between {$\sim$}3{$\sigma$}, when considering the offset in S8, and {$\sim$}2{$\sigma$}, when considering the full multi-dimensional parameter space.},

We highlight some noteworthy objects in the sample, including potentially projected systems, clusters with strong lensing features, clusters with active central galaxies or star formation, and systems of multiple clusters that may be physically associated.

  abstract = {Determinations of the motion of the sun with respect to the extra-galactic   nebulae have involved a K term of several hundred kilometers which appears to be variable. Explanations of this paradox have been sought in a correlation between apparent radial velocities and distances, but so far the results have not been convincing. The present paper is a re-examination of the question, based on only those nebular distances which are believed to be fairly reliable. Distances of extra-galactic nebulae depend ultimately upon the application of absolute-luminosity criteria to involved stars whose types can be recognized. These include, among others, Cepheid variables, novae, and blue stars involved in emission nebulosity. Numerical values depend upon the zero point of the period-luminosity relation among Cepheids, the other criteria merely check the order of the distances. This method is restricted to the few nebulae which are well resolved by existing instruments. A study of these nebulae, together with those in which any stars at all can be recognized, indicates the probability of an approximately uniform upper limit to the absolute luminosity of stars, in the late-type spirals and irregular nebulae at least, of the order of M (photographic) = -6.3. The apparent luminosities of the brightest stars in such nebulae are thus criteria which, although rough and to be applied with caution, furnish reasonable estimates of the distances of all extra-galactic systems in which even a few stars can be detected.},

  abstract = {We use the largest complete sample of 64 galaxy clusters (HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample) with available high-quality X-ray data from Chandra, and apply 16 cool-core diagnostics to them, some of them new. In order to identify the best parameter for characterizing cool-core clusters and quantify its relation to other parameters, we mainly use very high spatial resolution profiles of central gas density and temperature, and quantities derived from them. We also correlate optical properties of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with X-ray properties. To segregate cool core and non-cool-core clusters, we find that central cooling time, \emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cool{$<$}sub/{$>$}, is the best parameter for low redshift clusters with high quality data, and that cuspiness is the best parameter for high redshift clusters. 72\% of clusters in our sample have a cool core (\emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cool{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 7.7 \emph{h{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{71{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{-1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$} Gyr) and 44\% have strong cool cores (\emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cool{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 1.0 \emph{h{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{71{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{-1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$} Gyr). We find strong cool-core clusters are characterized as having low central entropy and a systematic central temperature drop. Weak cool-core clusters have enhanced central entropies and temperature profiles that are flat or decrease slightly towards the center. Non-cool-core clusters have high central entropies. For the first time we show quantitatively that the discrepancy in classical and spectroscopic mass deposition rates can not be explained with a recent formation of the cool cores, demonstrating the need for a heating mechanism to explain the cooling flow problem. We find that strong cool-core clusters have a distribution of central temperature drops, centered on 0.4\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{vir{$<$}sub/{$>$}. However, the radius at which the temperature begins to drop varies. This lack of a universal inner temperature profile probably reflects the complex physics in cluster cores not directly related to the cluster as a whole. Our results suggest that the central temperature does not correlate with the mass of the BCGs and weakly correlates with the expected radiative cooling only for strong cool-core clusters. Since 88\% of the clusters in our sample have a BCG within a projected distance of 50 \emph{h{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{71{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} kpc from the X-ray peak, we argue that it is easier to heat the gas (e.g. with mergers or non-gravitational processes) than to separate the dense core from the brightest cluster galaxy. Diffuse, Mpc-scale radio emission, believed to be associated with major mergers, has not been unambiguously detected in any of the strong cool-core clusters in our sample. Of the weak cool-core clusters and non-cool-core clusters, most of the clusters (seven out of eight) that have diffuse, Mpc-scale radio emission have a large ({$>$} 50 \emph{h{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{71{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} kpc) projected separation between their BCG and X-ray peak. In contrast, only two of the 56 clusters with a small separation between the BCG and X-ray peak (\emph{{$<<$}i/{$>$}50 \emph{h{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{71{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} kpc) show large-scale radio emission. Based on this result, we argue that a large projected separation between the BCG and the X-ray peak is a good indicator of a major merger. The properties of weak cool-core clusters as an intermediate class of objects are discussed. Finally we describe individual properties of all 64 clusters in the sample.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

This effect produces a distortion of CMB blackbody emission law. This distortion law depends on the electronic temperature of the intra-cluster hot gas, \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{e{$<$}sub/{$>$}, through the so-called tSZ relativistic corrections. In this work, we have performed a statistical analysis of the tSZ spectral distortion on large galaxy cluster samples. We performed a stacking analysis for several electronic temperature bins, using both spectroscopic measurements of X-ray temperatures and a scaling relation between X-ray luminosities and electronic temperatures. We report the first high significance detection of the relativistic tSZ at a significance of 5.3\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}. We also demonstrate that the observed tSZ relativistic corrections are consistent with X-ray deduced temperatures. This measurement of the tSZ spectral law demonstrates that tSZ effect spectral distorsion can be used as a probe to measure galaxy cluster temperatures.}}}},

  abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach\'on in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r {$\sim$} 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

These models predict very rapid negative evolution, in conflict with the clusters investigated by Gunn (1990). Self-similar models are applied to the new determination of the temperature and luminosity functions. For a spectral index greater than approximately -1, the evolution of the TF is found to be acceptable, but the evolution of the LF is in the opposite sense from that observed. A simple 'preheated intergalactic medium' model for X-ray cluster formation is introduced. It is shown that this model accounts quite well for the observed correlations of gross properties of clusters. This is applied to make concrete predictions for the evolution of the LF.},

  abstract = {High-resolution mapping of the intracluster medium (ICM) up to high redshift and down to low masses is crucial to derive accurate mass estimates of the galaxy cluster and to understand the systematic effects affecting cosmological studies based on galaxy clusters. We present a spatially resolved Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)/X-ray analysis of ACT-CL J0215.4+0030, a high-redshift (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.865) galaxy cluster of intermediate mass (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\simeq$} 3.5 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) observed as part of the ongoing NIKA2 SZ large program, which is a follow-up of a representative sample of objects at 0.5 {$\leq$} \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\leq$} 0.9. In addition to the faintness and small angular size induced by its mass and redshift, the cluster is contaminated by point sources that significantly affect the SZ signal. This is therefore an interesting case study for the most challenging sources of the NIKA2 cluster sample. We present the NIKA2 observations of this cluster and the resulting data. We identified the point sources that affect the NIKA2 maps of the cluster as submillimeter galaxies with counterparts in catalogs of sources constructed by the SPIRE instrument on board the \emph{Herschel{$<$}i/{$>$} observatory. We reconstructed the ICM pressure profile by performing a joint analysis of the SZ signal and of the point-source component in the NIKA2 150 GHz map. This cluster is a very weak source that lies below the selection limit of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} catalog. Nonetheless, we obtained high-quality estimates of the ICM thermodynamical properties with NIKA2. We compared the pressure profile extracted from the NIKA2 map to the pressure profile obtained from X-ray data alone by deprojecting the public \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} observations of the cluster. We combined the NIKA2 pressure profile with the X-ray deprojected density to extract detailed information on the ICM. The radial distribution of its thermodynamic properties (the pressure, temperature and entropy) indicate that the cluster has a highly disturbed core. We also computed the hydrostatic mass of the cluster, which is compatible with estimations from SZ and X-ray scaling relations. We conclude that the NIKA2 SZ large program can deliver quality information on the thermodynamics of the ICM even for one of its faintest clusters after a careful treatment of the contamination by point sources.}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The possibility of determining the value of the Hubble constant using  observations of galaxy clusters in X-ray and microwave wavelengths through the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect has long been known. Previous measurements have been plagued by relatively large errors in the observational data and severe biases induced, for example, by cluster triaxiality and clumpiness. The advent of Planck allows us to map the Compton parameter y, that is, the amplitude of the SZ effect, with unprecedented accuracy at intermediate cluster-centric radii, which in turn allows performing a detailed spatially resolved comparison with X-ray measurements. Given such higher quality observational data, we developed a Bayesian approach that combines informed priors on the physics of the intracluster medium obtained from hydrodynamical simulations of massive clusters with measurement uncertainties. We applied our method to a sample of 61 galaxy clusters with redshifts up to z {$<$} 0.5 observed with Planck and XMM-Newton and find H0 = 67 {$\pm$} 3 km s-1 Mpc-1.},

  abstract = {Context. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) is one of the two focal  instruments of the Planck mission. It will observe the whole sky in six bands in the 100 GHz-1 THz range. Aims: The HFI instrument is designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with a sensitivity limited only by fundamental sources: the photon noise of the CMB itself and the residuals left after the removal of foregrounds. The two high frequency bands will provide full maps of the submillimetre sky, featuring mainly extended and point source foregrounds. Systematic effects must be kept at negligible levels or accurately monitored so that the signal can be corrected. This paper describes the HFI design and its characteristics deduced from ground tests and calibration. Methods: The HFI instrumental concept and architecture are feasible only by pushing new techniques to their extreme capabilities, mainly: (i) bolometers working at 100 mK and absorbing the radiation in grids; (ii) a dilution cooler providing 100 mK in microgravity conditions; (iii) a new type of AC biased readout electronics and (iv) optical channels using devices inspired from radio and infrared techniques. Results: The Planck-HFI instrument performance exceeds requirements for sensitivity and control of systematic effects. During ground-based calibration and tests, it was measured at instrument and system levels to be close to or better than the goal specification.},

  abstract = {We present a cosmological analysis of abundances and stacked  weak-lensing profiles of galaxy clusters, exploiting the AMICO KiDS-DR3 catalogue. The sample consists of 3652 galaxy clusters with intrinsic richness \$\textbackslash lambda\^*\textbackslash geq20\$, over an effective area of 377 deg\$\^2\$, in the redshift range \$z\textbackslash in[0.1,\textbackslash,0.6]\$. We quantified the purity and completeness of the sample through simulations. The statistical analysis has been performed by simultaneously modelling the comoving number density of galaxy clusters and the scaling relation between the intrinsic richnesses and the cluster masses, assessed through a stacked weak-lensing profile modelling. The fluctuations of the matter background density, caused by super-survey modes, have been taken into account in the likelihood. Assuming a flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, we constrained \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, \$S\_8 \textbackslash equiv \textbackslash sigma\_8(\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}/0.3)\^\{0.5\}\$, and the parameters of the mass-richness scaling relation. We obtained \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}=0.24\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\}\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8=0.89\^\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.05\}\$, \$S\_8=0.80\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.04\}\$. The constraint on \$S\_8\$ is consistent within 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ with the results from WMAP and Planck. Furthermore, we got constraints on the cluster mass scaling relation in agreement with those obtained from a previous weak-lensing only analysis.},

Crucial complementary information on neutrino masses can be obtained from the analysis of data on cosmological observables, such as the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background or the distribution of large-scale structure. In this review we describe in detail how free-streaming massive neutrinos affect the evolution of cosmological perturbations. We summarize the current bounds on the sum of neutrino masses that can be derived from various combinations of cosmological data, including the most recent analysis by the WMAP team. We also discuss how future cosmological experiments are expected to be sensitive to neutrino masses well into the sub-eV range.},

In this paper we propose to combine these two observables and show that it is possible to calibrate the masses of the full Stage-4 cluster catalog internally owing to the high signal to noise measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing convergence field. We find that a CMB Stage-4 experiment will constrain the hydrostatic bias parameter to sub-percent accuracy. We also show constraints on a nonparametric Y-M relationship which could be used to study its evolution with mass and redshift. Finally we present a joint likelihood for thermal SZ (tSZ) flux and mass measurements, and show that it could lead to a {$\sim$}5{$\sigma$} detection of the lower limit on the sum of the neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy ({$\sum$}m{$\nu$}=60 meV) once combined with measurements of the primordial CMB and CMB lensing power spectra assuming a cosmic-variance-limited measurement of the optical depth to reionization.},

  abstract = {This white paper describes the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), whose goal is the study of dark energy and related topics in fundamental physics with data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.},

  abstract = {We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg2, as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.},

  abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg\^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg\^2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\textasciitilde 27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\textasciitilde 1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

There are currently no representative optical weak lensing measurements of clusters that match the distance and average mass of this sample. We detect the lensing signal with a significance of .

Assuming that the clusters follow Navarro\textendash Frenk\textendash White (NFW) density profiles, we infer a mean mass of . We consider systematic uncertainties from cluster redshift errors, centering errors, and the shape of the NFW profile. These are all smaller than 30\% of our reported uncertainty.

Our study makes use of the broad far-infrared and submillimetre wavelength coverage (100-600 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m) only made possible by the combination of observations from the PACS and SPIRE instruments aboard the \emph{Herschel {$<$}i/{$>$}Space Observatory. Using a power-law temperature distribution model to derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dust emissivity spectral index for SMGs of \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} = 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.2. Our results unambiguously unveil the diversity of the SMG population. Some SMGs exhibit extreme infrared luminosities of s10 and relatively warm dust components, while others are fainter (a few times 10\textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. Although at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$}s2 classical SMGs ({$>$}5 mJy at 850 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m) have large infrared luminosities (s10\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}), objects only selected on their submm flux densities (without any redshift informations) probe a large range in dust temperatures and infrared luminosities. The extreme infrared luminosities of some SMGs (\emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{IR{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10\textsuperscript{12.7{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, 26/61 systems) imply star formation rates (SFRs) of {$>$}500 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} (assuming a Chabrier IMF and no dominant AGN contribution to the FIR luminosity). Such high SFRs are difficult to reconcile with a secular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-driven stage in the evolution of these galaxies. Another observational argument in favour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than that of SMGs of lower luminosities (s40 K as opposed to s25 K), consistent with observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies triggered by major mergers and with results from hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfer calculations. Moreover, we find that luminous SMGs are systematically offset from normal star-forming galaxies in the stellar mass-SFR plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburst events with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. On the other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity SMGs have cold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of star formation, and therefore might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation. However, the properties of this latter population, especially their dust temperature, should be treated with caution because at these luminosities SMGs are not a representative sample of the entire star-forming galaxy population.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

The data set employed here consists of Chandra observations of 40 such clusters, identified in a comprehensive search of the Chandra archive for hot (kT {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5 keV), massive, morphologically relaxed systems, as well as high-quality weak gravitational lensing data for a subset of these clusters. Here we present cosmological constraints from measurements of the gas mass fraction, fgas, for this cluster sample. By incorporating a robust gravitational lensing calibration of the X-ray mass estimates, and restricting our measurements to the most self-similar and accurately measured regions of clusters, we significantly reduce systematic uncertainties compared to previous work. Our data for the first time constrain the intrinsic scatter in fgas, 7.4 {$\pm$} 2.3 per cent in a spherical shell at radii 0.8-1.2 r2500 ({$\sim$}1/4 of the virial radius), consistent with the expected level of variation in gas depletion and non-thermal pressure for relaxed clusters. From the lowest redshift data in our sample, five clusters at z {$<$} 0.16, we obtain a constraint on a combination of the Hubble parameter and cosmic baryon fraction, h3/2 {$\Omega$}b/{$\Omega$}m = 0.089 {$\pm$} 0.012, that is insensitive to the nature of dark energy. Combining this with standard priors on h and {$\Omega$}bh2 provides a tight constraint on the cosmic matter density, {$\Omega$}m = 0.27 {$\pm$} 0.04, which is similarly insensitive to dark energy. Using the entire cluster sample, extending to z {$>$} 1, we obtain consistent results for {$\Omega$}m and interesting constraints on dark energy: {$\Omega$} \_\{\{{$\Lambda$} \}\}=0.65\^\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.22\}{$>$} for non-flat {$\Lambda$}CDM (cosmological constant) models, and w = -0.98 {$\pm$} 0.26 for flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state. Our results are both competitive and consistent with those from recent cosmic microwave background, Type Ia supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data. We present constraints on more complex models of evolving dark energy from the combination of fgas data with these external data sets, and comment on the possibilities for improved fgas constraints using current and next-generation X-ray observatories and lensing data.},

  abstract = {We present the results of an X-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clusters selected in the 2500 deg2 South Pole Telescope survey and observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We divide the full sample into subsamples of {$\sim$}20 clusters based on redshift and central density, performing a joint X-ray spectral fit to all clusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the temperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the temperature profile over 0 {$<$} r {$<$} 1.5R 500, which would be impossible on a per-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on average, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first constraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z = 0 to z = 1.2. We find that high-z (0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.2) clusters are slightly ({$\sim$}30\%) cooler both in the inner (r {$<$} 0.1R 500) and outer (r {$>$} R 500) regions than their low-z (0.3 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with measured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average pressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Confirming earlier results from this data set, we find an absence of strong cool cores at high z, manifested in this analysis as a significantly lower observed pressure in the central 0.1R 500 of the high-z cool-core subset of clusters compared to the low-z cool-core subset. Overall, our observed pressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements, suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the core. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at r {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.7R 500\textemdash this may reflect a long-standing balance between cooling and feedback over long timescales and large physical scales. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r {$\greaterequivlnt$} R 500 in our high-z subsample. This flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due to the enhanced ({$\sim$}3\texttimes ) rate at which group-mass ({$\sim$}2 keV) halos, which would go undetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z {$\sim$} 1. This work demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially resolved cluster properties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but the number of observed clusters is high.},

We evaluate its performance in terms of completeness, contamination rate and photometric recovery for three representative types of SZ survey: a high resolution single frequency radio survey (AMI), a high resolution ground-based multiband survey (SPT), and the Planck all-sky survey. These surveys are not purely flux limited, and they loose completeness significantly before their point-source detection thresholds. Contamination remains relatively low at {$<$}5\% (less than 30\%) for a detection threshold set at S/N=5 (S/N=3). We identify photometric recovery as an important source of catalog uncertainty: dispersion in recovered flux from multiband surveys is larger than the intrinsic scatter in the Y-M relation predicted from hydrodynamical simulations, while photometry in the single frequency survey is seriously compromised by confusion with primary cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The latter effect implies that follow-up observations in other wavebands (e.g., 90 GHz, X-ray) of single frequency surveys will be required. Cluster morphology can cause a bias in the recovered Y-M relation, but has little effect on the scatter; the bias would be removed during calibration of the relation. Point source confusion only slightly decreases multiband survey completeness; single frequency survey completeness could be significantly reduced by radio point source confusion, but this remains highly uncertain because we do not know the radio counts at the relevant flux levels.},

We developed and applied a matched multi-filter (MMF) capable of dealing with the different transfer functions and resolutions of the two datasets. We verified that it produces results consistent with publications from Planck and SPT collaborations when applied on the datasets individually. We also verified that Planck and SPT-SZ cluster fluxes are consistent with each other. When applied blindly to the combined dataset, the MMF generated a catalog of 419 detections (S/N \&gt; 5), of which 323 are already part of the SPT-SZ or PSZ2 catalogs; 54 are new SZ detections, which have been identified in other catalogs or surveys; and 42 are new unidentified candidates. The MMF takes advantage of the complementarity of the two datasets, Planck being particularly useful for detecting clusters at a low redshift (z \&lt; 0.3), while SPT is efficient at finding higher redshift (z \&gt; 0.3) sources. This work represents a proof of concept that blind cluster extraction can be performed on combined, inhomogeneous millimeter datasets acquired from space and ground. This result is of prime importance for planned ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments (e.g., Simons Observatory, CMB-S4) and envisaged CMB space missions (e.g., PICO, Backlight) that will detect hundreds of thousands of clusters in the low mass regime (M\textsubscript{500} {$\leq$} 10\textsuperscript{14} M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}), for which the various sources of intra-cluster emission (gas, dust, synchrotron) will be of the same order of magnitude and hence require broad ground and space frequency coverage with a comparable spatial resolution for adequate separation. {$<$}P /{$>$}The catalogue is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{$>$}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/647/A106"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/647/A106{$<$}/A{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present the optical and X-ray properties of 68 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at 148 GHz by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Our sample, from an area of 504 deg2 centered on the celestial equator, is divided into two regions. The main region uses 270 deg2 of the ACT survey that overlaps with the co-added ugriz imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over Stripe 82 plus additional near-infrared pointed observations with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope. We confirm a total of 49 clusters to z {$\approx$} 1.3, of which 22 (all at z {$>$} 0.55) are new discoveries. For the second region, the regular-depth SDSS imaging allows us to confirm 19 more clusters up to z {$\approx$} 0.7, of which 10 systems are new. We present the optical richness, photometric redshifts, and separation between the SZ position and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find no significant offset between the cluster SZ centroid and BCG location and a weak correlation between optical richness and SZ-derived mass. We also present X-ray fluxes and luminosities from the ROSAT All Sky Survey which confirm that this is a massive sample. One of the newly discovered clusters, ACT-CL J0044.4+0113 at z = 1.1 (photometric), has an integrated XMM-Newton X-ray temperature of kTX = 7.9 {$\pm$} 1.0 keV and combined mass of M 200a = 8.2+3.3 \textendash 2.5 \texttimes{} 1014 h \textendash 1 70 M {$\Sun$}, placing it among the most massive and X-ray-hot clusters known at redshifts beyond z = 1. We also highlight the optically rich cluster ACT-CL J2327.4\textendash 0204 (RCS2 2327) at z = 0.705 (spectroscopic) as the most significant detection of the whole equatorial sample with a Chandra-derived mass of M 200a = 1.9+0.6 \textendash 0.4 \texttimes{} 1015 h \textendash 1 70 M {$\Sun$}, placing it in the ranks of the most massive known clusters like El Gordo and the Bullet Cluster.},

  abstract = {eROSITA is the primary instrument on the Russian SRG mission. In the first four years of scientific operation after its launch, foreseen for 2014, it will perform a deep survey of the entire X-ray sky. In the soft X-ray band (0.5-2 keV), this will be about 20 times more sensitive than the ROSAT all sky survey, while in the hard band (2-10 keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky at those energies. Such a sensitive all-sky survey will revolutionize our view of the high-energy sky, and calls for major efforts in synergic, multi-wavelength wide area surveys in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of the X-ray data. The design-driving science of eROSITA is the detection of very large samples (\textasciitilde 10\^5 objects) of galaxy clusters out to redshifts z{$>$}1, in order to study the large scale structure in the Universe, test and characterize cosmological models including Dark Energy. eROSITA is also expected to yield a sample of around 3 millions Active Galactic Nuclei, including both obscured and un-obscured objects, providing a unique view of the evolution of supermassive black holes within the emerging cosmic structure. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including accreting binaries, active stars and diffuse emission within the Galaxy, as well as solar system bodies that emit X-rays via the charge exchange process. Finally, such a deep imaging survey at high spectral resolution, with its scanning strategy sensitive to a range of variability timescales from tens of seconds to years, will undoubtedly open up a vast discovery space for the study of rare, unpredicted, or unpredictable high-energy astrophysical phenomena. In this living document we present a comprehensive description of the main scientific goals of the mission, with strong emphasis on the early survey phases.},

As a few pioneering studies have already shown, SZ observations both complement X-ray observations\textemdash the traditional tool for studying the intra-cluster medium\textemdash and bring unique capabilities for probing astrophysical processes at high redshifts and out to the low-density regions in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Advances in SZ observations have largely been driven by developments in centimetre-, millimetre-, and submillimetre-wave instrumentation on ground-based facilities, with notable exceptions including results from the Planck satellite. Here we review the utility of the thermal, kinematic, relativistic, non-thermal, and polarised SZ effects for studies of galaxy clusters and other large scale structures, incorporating the many advances over the past two decades that have impacted SZ theory, simulations, and observations. We also discuss observational results, techniques, and challenges, and aim to give an overview and perspective on emerging opportunities, with the goal of highlighting some of the exciting new directions in this field.},

  abstract = {We present 90, 140, and 268 GHz subarcminute resolution imaging of the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in the disturbed, intermediate-redshift (z = 0.5458) galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745, a triple-merger system comprising four distinct, optically detected subclusters. Our 90 GHz SZE data result in a sensitive, 34 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 map of the SZE at 13'' effective resolution using the MUSTANG bolometer array on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Our 140 and 268 GHz SZE imaging, with resolutions of 58'' and 31'' and sensitivities of 1.8 and 3.3 mJy beam-1, respectively, was obtained through observations from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory using Bolocam. We compare these maps to a two-dimensional pressure map derived from Chandra X-ray observations. Our MUSTANG SZE data confirm previous indications from Chandra of a pressure enhancement due to shock-heated, {$>\sptilde$} 20 keV gas immediately adjacent to extended radio emission seen in low-frequency radio maps of this cluster. MUSTANG also detects pressure substructure that is not well constrained by the Chandra X-ray data in the remnant core of a merging subcluster. We find that the small-scale pressure enhancements in the MUSTANG data amount to \textasciitilde 2\% of the total pressure measured in the 140 GHz Bolocam observations. The X-ray inferred pseudo-pressure template also fails on larger scales to accurately describe the Bolocam data, particularly at the location of the subcluster with a remnant core known to have a high line-of-sight optical velocity of \textasciitilde 3200 km s-1. Our Bolocam data are adequately described when we add an additional component\textemdash not described by a thermal SZE spectrum\textemdash to the X-ray template coincident with this subcluster. Using flux densities extracted from our model fits, and marginalizing over the X-ray spectroscopic temperature constraints for the region, we fit a thermal + kinetic SZE spectrum to our Bolocam data and find that the subcluster has a best-fit line-of-sight proper velocity vz = 3600+3440 - 2160 km s-1, in agreement with the optical velocity estimates for the subcluster. The probability vz {$<$}= 0 given our measurements is 2.1\%. Repeating this analysis using flux densities measured directly from our maps results in a 3.4\% probability vz {$<$}= 0. We note that this tantalizing result for the kinetic SZE is on resolved, subcluster scales.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the relation between the masses of cluster-  and group-sized haloes, extracted from {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological N-body and hydrodynamic simulations, and their velocity dispersion at different redshifts from z = 2 to 0. The main aim of this analysis is to understand how the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects such relations, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the baryonic physics. In our analysis, we use several sets of simulations with different physics implemented: one DM-only simulation, one simulation with non-radiative gas, and two radiative simulations, one of which with feedback from active galactic nuclei. Velocity dispersions are determined using three different tracers: DM particles, subhaloes and galaxies. We confirm that DM particles trace a relation that is fully consistent with the theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem, {$\sigma$}v {$\propto$} M{$\alpha$} with {$\alpha$} = 1/3, and with previous results presented in the literature. On the other hand, subhaloes and galaxies trace steeper relations, with velocity dispersion scaling with mass with {$\alpha$} {$>$} 1/3, and with larger values of the normalization. Such relations imply that galaxies and subhaloes have a {$\sim$}10 per cent velocity bias relative to the DM particles, which can be either positive or negative, depending on the halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation. We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamical friction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not on DM particles. These processes appear to be more or less effective, depending on the halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create a non-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the {$\sigma$}1D-M200 relation on the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift. These results are relevant in view of the application of velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large redshift surveys.},

  abstract = {This White Paper, submitted to the recent ESA call for science themes to  define its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformational leap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) How does ordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2) How do black holes grow and shape the Universe? Hot gas in clusters, groups and the intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe. To understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and assembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical properties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy with a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolving power compared to currently planned facilities. Feedback from supermassive black holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxy evolution models, but it is not well understood. X-ray observations can uniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes and determine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to the effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires knowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic time, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray emission is the most reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed must improve by a factor \textasciitilde 100 over current facilities to perform a full census into the early Universe. The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution, spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will also provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.},

  abstract = {In the 20+ years of Doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovered a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet-planet interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (MMR). An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further computational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter space ({$\sim$}7 \texttimes{} number of planets) that can have complex parameter correlations, particularly for systems near a MMR. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential evolution MCMC (DEMCMC) algorithm applied to radial velocity data while incorporating self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body DEMCMC (RUN DMC) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of the traditional MCMC by using an ensemble of Markov chains to adaptively improve the proposal distribution. RUN DMC can sample more efficiently from high-dimensional parameter spaces that have strong correlations between model parameters. We describe the methodology behind the algorithm, along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We find that most algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However, the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to the details of individual planetary systems (e.g., number of planets, number of observations, orbital periods, and signal-to-noise of each planet), we offer recommendations for choosing the DEMCMC algorithm's algorithmic parameters that result in excellent performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.},

If we relax the \emph{w{$<$}i/{$>$} parameter, the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} CMB uncertainties increase by a factor of \textasciitilde 10 and become comparable with those from XXL clusters.

  abstract = {We present a model of the longwave atmospheric spectrum that improves in many   respects widely used older models such as the microwave propagation model (MPM), since it is based on broadband measurements and calculations. According to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 THz while including lines up to 10 THz. Its primary goal is to simulate the millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up to \textasciitilde 2 THz at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 THz accessible only under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species. The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms based on FTS measurements between 170 and 1100 GHz: collision-induced absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric molecules (N 2 and O2) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All H2O lines up to 10 THz are included in order to correctly account for the entire H2O far-wing opacity below 2 THz for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models used to date. Phase delays near H2O and O2 resonances are also important for ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array (ALMA) project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at microwaves (ATM) has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy.}

  abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, {$\Omega$}M, and cosmological-constant energy density, {$\Omega\Lambda$}, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Cal\'an/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8{$\Omega$}M-0.6{$\Omega\Lambda\sptilde$}-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest ({$\Omega$}M{$<\sptilde$}1.5). For a flat ({$\Omega$}M+{$\Omega\Lambda$}=1) cosmology we find {$\Omega$}flatM=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 {$\sigma$} statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a {$\Lambda$}=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, {$\Lambda$}=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P({$\Lambda>$}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal\'an/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} NIKA2 is a dual-band millimetre continuum camera of 2 900 kinetic inductance detectors, operating at 150 and 260 GHz, installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope in Spain. Open to the scientific community since October 2017, NIKA2 will provide key observations for the next decade to address a wide range of open questions in astrophysics and cosmology.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our aim is to present the calibration method and the performance assessment of NIKA2 after one year of observation.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used a large data set acquired between January 2017 and February 2018 including observations of primary and secondary calibrators and faint sources that span the whole range of observing elevations and atmospheric conditions encountered by the IRAM 30-m telescope. This allowed us to test the stability of the performance parameters against time evolution and observing conditions. We describe a standard calibration method, referred to as the ``Baseline'' method, to translate raw data into flux density measurements. This includes the determination of the detector positions in the sky, the selection of the detectors, the measurement of the beam pattern, the estimation of the atmospheric opacity, the calibration of absolute flux density scale, the flat fielding, and the photometry. We assessed the robustness of the performance results using the Baseline method against systematic effects by comparing results using alternative methods.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We report an instantaneous field of view of 6.5{${'}$} in diameter, filled with an average fraction of 84\%, and 90\% of valid detectors at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively. The beam pattern is characterised by a FWHM of 17.6{${''}$} {$\pm$} 0.1{${''}$} and 11.1{${''}$} {$\pm$} 0.2{${''}$}, and a main-beam efficiency of 47\%{$\pm$}3\%, and 64\%{$\pm$}3\% at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively. The point-source rms calibration uncertainties are about 3\% at 150 GHz and 6\% at 260 GHz. This demonstrates the accuracy of the methods that we deployed to correct for atmospheric attenuation. The absolute calibration uncertainties are of 5\%, and the systematic calibration uncertainties evaluated at the IRAM 30-m reference Winter observing conditions are below 1\% in both channels. The noise equivalent flux density at 150 and 260 GHz are of 9 {$\pm$} 1 mJy s\textsuperscript{1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$} and 30 {$\pm$} 3 mJy s\textsuperscript{1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$}.

  abstract = {Taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broadfrequency range of the \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}satellite, we study the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and pressure profiles of 62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-month nominal survey. Careful reconstruction of the SZ signal indicates that most clusters are individually detected at least out to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. By stacking the radial profiles, we have statistically detected the radial SZ signal out to 3 \texttimes{} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, i.e., at a density contrast of about 50\textendash 100, though the dispersion about the mean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range. Our measurement is fully consistent with previous \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}results on integrated SZ fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between SZ and X-ray measurements inside \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Correcting for the effects of the \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}beam, we have calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. This new constraint from SZ measurements is consistent with the X-ray constraints from \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} in the region in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1\textendash 1] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}), and is in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. At larger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than most predictions from numerical simulations. Combining the SZ and X-ray observed profiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fit parameters [\emph{P{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$},\emph{c{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}\emph{,{$\gamma$},{$\alpha$},{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} ] = [6.41,1.81,0.31,1.33,4.13 ] . Using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirts we reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profile out to 3 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Within the temperature driven uncertainties, our \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}constraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gas fraction in halos.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} and SZ signal \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$} calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} and matter density parameter {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} in a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textendash\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30\%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.75 {$\pm$} 0.03, {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.02, and \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$}({$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$}/ 0.27)\textsuperscript{0.3{$<$}sup/{$>$} = 0.764 {$\pm$} 0.025. The value of \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20\% (the central value from numerical simulations) we find \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$}({$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$}/0.27)\textsuperscript{0.3{$<$}sup/{$>$} = 0.78 {$\pm$} 0.01 and a tighter one-dimensional range \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.77 {$\pm$} 0.02. We find that the larger values of \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} and {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} preferred by \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}'s measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40\%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the {$\Lambda$}CDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmologicalparameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make further progress in this field.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper). From the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature data combined with \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{s{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$} = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} \emph{m{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{{$\nu<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{\emph{K{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$><$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}(\emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}) {$\propto$} \emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} potential. The addition of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w{$<$}i/{$>$} = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} full mission data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, (1-\emph{b{$<$}i/{$>$}). In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} analysis of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of (1-\emph{b{$<$}i/{$>$}) the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial (3.7\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}) for the largest estimated value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model by combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10\%-level to 1\% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM model.}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We present the all-sky \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources detected from the 29 month full-mission data. The catalogue (PSZ2) is the largest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest systematic all-sky surveyof galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which 1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data sets, and is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing {$>$}10\textsuperscript{3{$<$}sup/{$>$} confirmed clusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of 83\% on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the estimates of the SZ strength parameter \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{5\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}500{$<$}sub/{$>$}are robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate conversion to \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} requires the use of prior information on the cluster extent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical, and X-ray data sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart match. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a population of low-redshift X-ray under-luminous clusters revealed by SZ selection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent properties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected samples.}}}}}}}},

Specific masks are defined to minimize foreground residuals and systematics. Using these masks, we compute the \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$}-map angular power spectrum and higher order statistics. From these we conclude that the \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$}-map is dominated by tSZ signal in the multipole range, 20 {$<$}\emph{{$\mathscr{l}<$}i/{$><$} 600.

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5{$\sigma$} level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {$\Omega$}ch2 = 0.120 {$\pm$} 0.001, baryon density {$\Omega$}bh2 = 0.0224 {$\pm$} 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 {$\pm$} 0.004, and optical depth {$\tau$} = 0.054 {$\pm$} 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100\texttheta * = 1.0411 {$\pm$} 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 {$\pm$} 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter {$\Omega$}m = 0.315 {$\pm$} 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 = 0.811 {$\pm$} 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 {$\pm$} 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2{$\sigma$}, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {$\Omega$}K = 0.001 {$\pm$} 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 {$\pm$} 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {$<$} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6{$\sigma$}, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (\texttheta *) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the {$\Lambda$}CDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

  abstract = {The Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) is a 524-orbit Multi-Cycle Treasury Program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25 galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The CLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive (kT {$>$} 5 keV) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (\texttheta Ein {$>$} 35'' at zs = 2) to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z {$>$} 7) galaxies. A total of 16 broadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each 20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise ({$\sigma$} z \textasciitilde{} 0.02(1 + z)) photometric redshifts for newly discovered arcs. Observations of each cluster are spread over eight epochs to enable a search for Type Ia supernovae at z {$>$} 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of supernovae. We present newly re-derived X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and Fe abundances for the CLASH clusters as well as a representative source list for MACS1149.6+2223 (z = 0.544).},

  abstract = {We study the concentration of dark matter haloes and its evolution in N-body simulations of the standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology. The results presented in this paper are based on four large N-body simulations with {$\sim$}10 billion particles each: the Millennium-I and -II, Bolshoi and MultiDark simulations. The MultiDark (or BigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state of the art of our current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter haloes in the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets, despite the different codes, numerical algorithms and halo/subhalo finders used in our analysis. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration c(M, z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field {$\sigma$}(M, z), the halo concentration c({$\sigma$}) shows a nearly universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well-defined scale at {$\sigma\sim$} 0.71. Yet, some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end ({$\sigma$} \&lt; 1), the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This c\textendash{$\sigma$}(M, z) relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger \textendash{} by a factor up to 1.5 \textendash{} than previous results from smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of observations.},

  abstract = {We examine the X-ray luminosity scaling relations of 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the Representative \emph{XMM-Newton {$<$}i/{$>$} Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS). The objects are selected only in X-ray luminosity, optimally sampling the cluster luminosity function. Temperatures range from 2 to 9 keV, and there is no bias toward any particular morphological type. To reduce measurement scatter we extract pertinent values in an aperture corresponding to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, estimated using the tight correlation between \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} (the product of gas mass and temperature) and total mass. The data exhibit power law relations between bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature, \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} and total mass, all with slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. We examine the possible causes for the steepening, finding that structural variations have little effect and that the primary driver appears to be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. Scatter about the relations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. The natural logarithmic scatter about the raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is about 70 per cent, and about the X-ray luminosity-\emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation it is 40 per cent. Systems with more morphological substructure show similar scatter about scaling relations than clusters with less substructure, due to the preponderance of cool core systems in the regular cluster subsample. Cool core and morphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space with respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically at the high luminosity side, the latter lying systematically at the low luminosity side. Simple exclusion of the central regions serves to reduce the scatter about the scaling relations by more than a factor of two. The scatter reduces by a similar amount with the use of the central gas density as a third parameter. Using \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} as a total mass proxy, we derive a Malmquist bias-corrected local luminosity-mass relation and compare with other recent determinations. Our results indicate that luminosity can be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has important implications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to be undertaken with \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{eROSITA{$<$}i/{$>$}, and ultimately for the use of the cluster population for cosmological purposes.}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The total mass of a galaxy cluster is one of its most fundamental  properties. Together with the redshift, the mass links observation and theory, allowing us to use the cluster population to test models of structure formation and to constrain cosmological parameters. Building on the rich heritage from X-ray surveys, new results from Sunyaev-Zeldovich and optical surveys have stimulated a resurgence of interest in cluster cosmology. These studies have generally found fewer clusters than predicted by the baseline Planck {$\Lambda$}CDM model, prompting a renewed effort on the part of the community to obtain a definitive measure of the true cluster mass scale. Here we review recent progress on this front. Our theoretical understanding continues to advance, with numerical simulations being the cornerstone of this effort. On the observational side, new, sophisticated techniques are being deployed in individual mass measurements and to account for selection biases in cluster surveys. We summarise the state of the art in cluster mass estimation methods and the systematic uncertainties and biases inherent in each approach, which are now well identified and understood, and explore how current uncertainties propagate into the cosmological parameter analysis. We discuss the prospects for improvements to the measurement of the mass scale using upcoming multi-wavelength data, and the future use of the cluster population as a cosmological probe.},

  abstract = {We examine the radial entropy distribution and its scaling using 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the representative \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} cluster structure survey (REXCESS), a sample in the temperature range 2-9 keV selected in X-ray luminosity only, with no bias toward any particular morphological type. The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{1000{$<$}sub/{$>$} in all systems and out to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} in thirteen systems. Compared to theoretical expectations from non-radiative cosmological simulations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent excess entropy, such that the excess is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass systems. At \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible within the large observational and theoretical uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy is shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius, becoming consistent with self-similar at \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. There is a large dispersion in scaled entropy in the inner regions, apparently linked to the presence of cool cores and dynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by approximately a factor of two to 30 per cent, and the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. There are two peaks in the distribution of both inner slope and, after parameterising the profiles with a power law plus constant model, in central entropy \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$}. However, we are unable to distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed distribution of \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} with the present data. The distribution of outer slopes is unimodal with a median value of 0.98, and there is a clear correlation of outer slope with temperature. Renormalising the dimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile \emph{f{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{gas{$<$}sub/{$>$} ({$<$}\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}), leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fraction variations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropy structural and scaling properties. The results are consistent with the picture of a cluster population in which entropy modification is centrally concentrated and extends to larger radii at lower mass, leading to both a radial and a mass-dependence in the gas mass fraction, but which is increasingly self-similar at large radius. The observed normalisation, however, would suggest entropy modification at least up to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{1000{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and even beyond, in all but the most massive systems. We discuss a tentative scenario to explain the observed behaviour of the entropy and gas mass fraction in the REXCESS sample, in which a combination of extra heating and merger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority of the population, and a smaller fraction of systems is able to develop a cool core.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Measurements of the thermal Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect have long been recognized as a powerful cosmological probe. Here we assess the importance of relativistic temperature corrections to the tSZ signal on the power spectrum analysis of the Planck Compton-y map, developing a novel formalism to account for the associated effects. The amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum is found to be sensitive to the effective electron temperature, \$\{\textbackslash bar\{T\}\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}\}\$, of the cluster sample. Omitting the corresponding modifications leads to an underestimation of the yypower spectrum amplitude. Relativistic corrections thus add to the error budget of tSZ power spectrum observables such as {$\sigma$}8. This could help alleviate the tension between various cosmological probes, with the correction scaling as \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash sigma \_8/\textbackslash sigma \_8 \textbackslash simeq 0.019\textbackslash, [k\{\textbackslash bar\{T\}\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}\}/5\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm keV\}]\$ for Planck. At the current level of precision, this implies a systematic shift by {$\simeq$} 1{$\sigma$}, which can also be interpreted as an overestimation of the hydrostatic mass bias by \$\textbackslash Delta b \textbackslash simeq 0.046\textbackslash, (1-b)\textbackslash, [k\{\textbackslash bar\{T\}\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}\}/5\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm keV\}]\$, bringing it into better agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. It is thus time to consider relativistic temperature corrections in the processing of current and future tSZ data.},

The combination of high-cadence, deep, wide-field optical photometry from LSST with high-resolution, wide-field optical photometry, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from Euclid will be powerful for addressing a wide range of astrophysical questions. We explore Euclid/LSST synergy, ignoring the political issues associated with data access to focus on the scientific, technical, and financial benefits of coordination. We focus primarily on dark energy cosmology, but also discuss galaxy evolution, transient objects, solar system science, and galaxy cluster studies. We concentrate on synergies that require coordination in cadence or survey overlap, or would benefit from pixel-level co-processing that is beyond the scope of what is currently planned, rather than scientific programs that could be accomplished only at the catalog level without coordination in data processing or survey strategies. We provide two quantitative examples of scientific synergies: the decrease in photo-z errors (benefiting many science cases) when high-resolution Euclid data are used for LSST photo-z determination, and the resulting increase in weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratio from smaller photo-z errors. We briefly discuss other areas of coordination, including high-performance computing resources and calibration data. Finally, we address concerns about the loss of independence and potential cross-checks between the two missions and the potential consequences of not collaborating.},

  abstract = {Addressing fundamental questions regarding our understanding of the Universe, such as the cause of its accelerated expansion or the nature of dark matter, requires to confront theories and observations. In this context, galaxy clusters can be used as powerful observational probes. However, their current utilisation is limited by uncertainties and systematic effects, notably affecting the measurement of their mass, which is presumably dominated by dark matter.Galaxy clusters can be studied at different wavelengths: the hot gas composing the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM) shines in X-ray and is observable at millimetre wavelengths via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, whereas galaxies emit principally in the optical and infrared. Combining and comparing these observables allows us to reduce the uncertainties and systematics in the cosmological constraints obtained from clusters. In this context, this thesis aims at paving the way of future large surveys such as Euclid and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. It presents the multi-wavelengths analyses of a sample of clusters detected in X-ray in the XXL survey, spanning a wide range of masses and redshifts. The first part of the thesis introduces the cosmological context and presents the observational properties of galaxies and clusters, and the ingredients to build cosmological cluster samples. The second part concentrates on the optical characterisation of XXL clusters and the properties of their member galaxies. It starts by presenting XXL and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), an optical counterpart survey. Then, it focuses on the characterisation of the CFHTLS photometric redshifts quality and their use to construct the optical galaxy luminosity functions (LF) of XXL clusters. The LF of satellite galaxies is found to slightly depend on cluster richness, the main optical mass proxy, but no significant redshift evolution is observed. Then, the study of the colour and active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction in XXL cluster galaxies is performed, finding that the mass plays a key role in shaping AGN and star formation activity in clusters. Finally, the WaZP optical cluster finder algorithm is used to investigate the optical counterparts of XXL clusters. The third part of this thesis is dedicated to the observational project dedicated to the mapping of the SZ signal in three distant XXL clusters, with the high angular resolution NIKA2 camera. The preparation of the project is discussed, making use of the X-ray and optical data to predict the expected SZ signal. Then, the observation procedure at the telescope and the data reduction, dedicated to produce calibrated SZ maps, are presented. The project is still ongoing and one cluster, XLSSC102, at z = 0.97, has been partially observed. The development of the blind detection of galaxies potentially contaminating the SZ signal is developed, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of dusty star forming galaxies in the field of XLSSC102. The morphology and dynamical state of XLSSC102 are then characterised using optical, SZ and X-ray data and the radial ICM thermodynamics and mass profiles are measured combining SZ and X-ray data. This allows us to show that XLSSC102 is a merging cluster with a mass {$\sim$} 3 \texttimes{} 10 14 M, and is compatible with the standard evolution scenario of cluster formation.},

  abstract = {High-mass clusters at low redshifts have been intensively studied at  various wavelengths. However, while more distant objects at lower masses constitute the bulk population of future surveys, their physical state remain poorly explored to date. In this paper, we present resolved observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, obtained with the NIKA2 camera, towards the cluster of galaxies XLSSC 102, a relatively low-mass system (M500 {$\sim$} 2 \texttimes{} 1014 M{$\odot$}) at z = 0.97 detected from the XXL survey. We combine NIKA2 SZ data, XMM-Newton X-ray data, and Megacam optical data to explore, respectively, the spatial distribution of the gas electron pressure, the gas density, and the galaxies themselves. We find significant offsets between the X-ray peak, the SZ peak, the brightest cluster galaxy, and the peak of galaxy density. Additionally, the galaxy distribution and the gas present elongated morphologies. This is interpreted as the sign of a recent major merging event, which induced a local boost of the gas pressure towards the north of XLSSC 102 and stripped the gas out of the galaxy group. The NIKA2 data are also combined with XXL data to construct the thermodynamic profiles of XLSSC 102, obtaining relatively tight constraints up to about {$\sim$}r500, and revealing properties that are typical of disturbed systems. We also explore the impact of the cluster centre definition and the implication of local pressure substructure on the recovered profiles. Finally, we derive the global properties of XLSSC 102 and compare them to those of high-mass-and-low-redshift systems, finding no strong evidence for non-standard evolution. We also use scaling relations to obtain alternative mass estimates from our profiles. The variation between these different mass estimates reflects the difficulty to accurately measure the mass of low-mass clusters at z {$\sim$} 1, especially with low signal-to-noise ratio data and for a disturbed system. However, it also highlights the strength of resolved SZ observations alone and in combination with survey-like X-ray data. This is promising for the study of high redshift clusters from the combination of eROSITA and high resolution SZ instruments and will complement the new generation of optical surveys from facilities such as LSST and Euclid.

  abstract = {We present an improved determination of the Hubble constant from Hubble  Space Telescope (HST) observations of 70 long-period Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These were obtained with the same WFC3 photometric system used to measure extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of SNe Ia. Gyroscopic control of HST was employed to reduce overheads while collecting a large sample of widely separated Cepheids. The Cepheid period-luminosity relation provides a zero-point-independent link with 0.4\% precision between the new 1.2\% geometric distance to the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) measured by Pietrzy\'nski et al. and the luminosity of SNe Ia. Measurements and analysis of the LMC Cepheids were completed prior to knowledge of the new DEB LMC distance. Combined with a refined calibration of the count-rate linearity of WFC3-IR with 0.1\% precision, these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the LMC from 2.5\% to 1.3\%. Using only the LMC DEBs to calibrate the ladder, we find H 0 = 74.22 {$\pm$} 1.82 km s-1 Mpc-1 including systematic uncertainties, 3\% higher than before for this particular anchor. Combining the LMC DEBs, masers in NGC 4258, and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H 0 = 74.03 {$\pm$} 1.42 km s-1 Mpc-1, including systematics, an uncertainty of 1.91\%-15\% lower than our best previous result. Removing any one of these anchors changes H 0 by less than 0.7\%. The difference between H 0 measured locally and the value inferred from Planck CMB and {$\Lambda$}CDM is 6.6 {$\pm$} 1.5 km s-1 Mpc-1 or 4.4{$\sigma$} (P = 99.999\% for Gaussian errors) in significance, raising the discrepancy beyond a plausible level of chance. We summarize independent tests showing that this discrepancy is not attributable to an error in any one source or measurement, increasing the odds that it results from a cosmological feature beyond {$\Lambda$}CDM.},

  abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia  supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {$<$} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {$>$}= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0 {$<$} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {$>$}= 0.},

  abstract = {Lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors(LEKIDs) have recently shown considerable promise as direct absorption mm-wavelength detectors for astronomical applications. One major research thrust within the N\'eel Iram Kids Array (NIKA) collaboration has been to investigate the suitability of these detectors for deployment at the 30-meter IRAM telescope located on Pico Veleta in Spain. Compared to microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKID), using quarter wavelength resonators, the resonant circuit of a LEKID consists of a discrete inductance and capacitance coupled to a feedline. A high and constant current density distribution in the inductive part of these resonators makes them very sensitive. Due to only one metal layer on a silicon substrate, the fabrication is relatively easy. In order to optimize the LEKIDs for this application, we have recently probed a wide variety of individual resonator and array parameters through simulation and physical testing. This included determining the optimal feed-line coupling, pixel geometry, resonator distribution within an array (in order to minimize pixel cross-talk), and resonator frequency spacing. Based on these results, a 144-pixel Aluminum array was fabricated and tested in a dilution fridge with optical access, yielding an average optical NEP of \textasciitilde 2E-16 W/Hz\^1/2 (best pixels showed NEP = 6E-17 W/Hz\^1/2 under 4-8 pW loading per pixel). In October 2010 the second prototype of LEKIDs has been tested at the IRAM 30 m telescope. A new LEKID geometry for 2 polarizations will be presented. Also first optical measurements of a titanium nitride array will be discussed.},

Whereas many previous SZ studies have parameterized the pressure profiles of galaxy clusters, non-parametric reconstructions will provide insights into the thermodynamic state of the intracluster medium.\emph{Aim{$<$}i/{$>$}. We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure profiles of the high redshift (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.89) galaxy cluster CLJ 1226.9+3332 as inferred from SZ data from the MUSTANG, NIKA, Bolocam, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments, which all probe different angular scales.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. Our non-parametric algorithm makes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For MUSTANG, NIKA, and Bolocam we derive a non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good agreement among the instruments. In particular, we find that the non-parametric profiles are consistent with a fitted generalized Navaro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile. Given the ability of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} to constrain the total signal, we include a prior on the integrated Compton \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$} parameter as determined by \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. For a given instrument, constraints on the pressure profile diminish rapidly beyond the field of view. The overlap in spatial scales probed by these four datasets is therefore critical in checking for consistency between instruments. By using multiple instruments, our analysis of CLJ 1226.9+3332 covers a large radial range, from the central regions to the cluster outskirts: 0.05 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 1.1 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}.

La caract\'erisation des processus associ\'es \`a l'origine et \`a la croissance des grandes structures permet de contraindre des param\`etres cosmologiques via l'\'etude de la distribution des amas en fonction de leur masse et de leur redshift.

  abstract = {The complete characterization of the pressure profile of high-redshift galaxy clusters, from their core to their outskirts, is a major issue for the study of the formation of large-scale structures. It is essential to constrain a potential redshift evolution of both the slope and scatter of the mass-observable scaling relations used in cosmology studies based on cluster statistics. In this paper, we present the first thermal Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (tSZ) mapping of a cluster from the sample of the New IRAM Kids Arrays (NIKA2) SZ large program that aims at constraining the redshift evolution of cluster pressure profiles and the tSZ-mass scaling relation. We observed the galaxy cluster PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 at redshift \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.58 with the NIKA2 camera, a dual-band (150 and 260 GHz) instrument operated at the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimtrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope. We identify a thermal pressure excess in the south-west region of PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 and a high-redshift sub-millimeter point source that affect the intracluster medium (ICM) morphology of the cluster. The NIKA2 data are used jointly with tSZ data acquired by the Multiplexed SQUID/TES Array at Ninety Gigahertz (MUSTANG), Bolocam, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} experiments in order to non-parametrically set the best constraints on the electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 0.02\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) to its outskirts (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 3\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}). We investigate the impact of the over-pressure region on the shape of the pressure profile and on the constraints on the integrated Compton parameter \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. A hydrostatic mass analysis is also performed by combining the tSZ-constrained pressure profile with the deprojected electronic density profile from \emph{XMM{$<$}i/{$>$}-\emph{Newton{$<$}i/{$>$}. This allows us to conclude that the estimates of \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} obtained from the analysis with and without masking the disturbed ICM region differ by 65\% and 79\%, respectively. This work highlights that NIKA2 will have a crucial impact on the characterization of the scatter of the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>-$}\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} scaling relation due to its high potential to constrain the thermodynamic and morphological properties of the ICM when used in synergy with X-ray observations of similar angular resolution. This study also presents the typical products that will be delivered to the community for all clusters included in the NIKA2 tSZ Large Program.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. The mean pressure profile of the galaxy cluster population plays an essential role in cosmological analyses. An accurate characterization of the shape, intrinsic scatter, and redshift evolution of this profile is necessary to estimate some of the biases and systematic effects that currently prevent cosmological analyses based on thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) surveys from obtaining precise and unbiased cosmological constraints. This is one of the main goals of the ongoing NIKA2 SZ large program, which aims at mapping the tSZ signal of a representative cluster sample selected from the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} and ACT catalogs and spans a redshift range 0.5 {$<$} \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.9.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. To estimate the impact of intracluster medium (ICM) disturbances that can be detected by NIKA2 on the mean pressure profile of galaxy clusters, we realized a study based on a synthetic cluster sample that is similar to that of the NIKA2 SZ large program.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. To reach this goal we employed the hydrodynamical N-body simulation Marenostrum MUltidark SImulations of galaxy Clusters (MUSIC). We simulated realistic NIKA2 and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} tSZ observations, which were jointly analyzed to estimate the ICM pressure profile of each cluster. A comparison of the deprojected profiles with the true radial profiles directly extracted from the MUSIC simulation allowed us to validate the NIKA2 tSZ pipeline and to study the impact of ICM disturbances on the characterization of the ICM pressure distribution even at high redshift. After normalizing each profile by the integrated quantities estimated under the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis, we evaluated the mean pressure profile of the twin sample and show that it is compatible with that extracted directly from the MUSIC simulation in the scale range that can be recovered by NIKA2. We studied the impact of cluster dynamical state on both its shape and associated scatter.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. We observe that at \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} the scatter of the distribution of normalized pressure profiles associated with the selected morphologically disturbed clusters is 65\% larger than that associated with relaxed clusters. Furthermore, we show that using a basic modeling of the thermal pressure distribution in the deprojection procedure induces a significant increase of the scatter associated with the mean normalized pressure profile compared to the true distribution extracted directly from the simulation.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. We conclude that the NIKA2 SZ large program will facilitate characterization of the potential redshift evolution of the mean pressure profile properties due to the performance of the NIKA2 camera, thereby allowing for a precise measurement of cluster morphology and ICM thermodynamic properties up to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} at high redshift.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The determination of the thermodynamic properties of clusters of galaxies at intermediate and high redshift can bring new insights into the formation of large-scale structures. It is essential for a robust calibration of the mass-observable scaling relations and their scatter, which are key ingredients for precise cosmology using cluster statistics. Here we illustrate an application of high resolution ({$<$}20 arcsec) thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) observations by probing the intracluster medium (ICM) of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}-discovered galaxy cluster PSZ1 G045.85+57.71 at redshift \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.61, using tSZ data obtained with the NIKA camera, which is a dual-band (150 and 260 GHz) instrument operated at the IRAM 30-m telescope. We deproject jointly NIKA and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} data to extract the electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 0.02 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) to its outskirts (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 3 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) non-parametrically for the first time at intermediate redshift. The constraints on the resulting pressure profile allow us to reduce the relative uncertainty on the integrated Compton parameter by a factor of two compared to the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} value. Combining the tSZ data and the deprojected electronic density profile from \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} allows us to undertake a hydrostatic mass analysis, for which we study the impact of a spherical model assumption on the total mass estimate. We also investigate the radial temperature and entropy distributions. These data indicate that PSZ1 G045.85+57.71 is a massive (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 5.5 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$}\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) cool-core cluster.

  abstract = {We present the results of a joint analysis of \$Chandra\$ X-ray and South  Pole Telescope (SPT) SZ observations targeting the first sample of galaxy clusters at \$0.3 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.3\$, selected to be the progenitors of well-studied nearby clusters based on their expected accretion rate. We develop a new procedure in order to tackle the analysis challenge that is estimating the intracluster medium (ICM) properties of low-mass and high-redshift clusters with \$\{\textbackslash sim\}150\$ X-ray counts. One of the dominant sources of uncertainty on the ICM density profile estimated with a standard X-ray analysis with such shallow X-ray data is due to the systematic uncertainty associated with the ICM temperature obtained through the analysis of the background-dominated X-ray spectrum. We show that we can decrease the uncertainty on the density profile by a factor \$\{\textbackslash sim\}5\$ with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness profile measured by \$Chandra\$ and the SZ integrated Compton parameter available in the SPT cluster catalog. We apply this technique to the whole sample of 67 clusters in order to track the evolution of the ICM core density during cluster growth. We confirm that the evolution of the gas density profile is well modeled by the combination of a fixed core and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core profile.

  abstract = {The characterization of the Intracluster Medium (ICM) properties of high-redshift galaxy clusters is fundamental to our understanding of large-scale structure formation processes. We present the results of a multiwavelength analysis of the very massive cluster MOO J1142+1527 at a redshift z = 1.2 discovered as part of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. This analysis is based on high angular resolution Chandra X-ray and NIKA2 Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (SZ) data. The cluster thermodynamic radial profiles have been obtained with unprecedented precision at this redshift and up to 0.7R 500, thanks to the combination of high-resolution X-ray and SZ data. The comparison between the galaxy distribution mapped in infrared by Spitzer and the morphological properties of the ICM derived from the combined analysis of the Chandra and NIKA2 data leads us to the conclusion that the cluster is an ongoing merger. We have estimated a systematic uncertainty on the cluster total mass that characterizes both the impact of the observed deviations from spherical symmetry and of the core dynamics on the mass profile. We further combine the X-ray and SZ data at the pixel level to obtain maps of the temperature and entropy distributions. We find a relatively low-entropy core at the position of the X-ray peak and high-temperature regions located on its south and west sides. This work demonstrates that the addition of spatially resolved SZ observations to low signal-to-noise X-ray data brings a high information gain on the characterization of the evolution of ICM thermodynamic properties at z {$>$} 1.},

The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in {$\sim$}500 CPU hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to {$\sim$}10, 000 deg2 of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of {$\sim$}25,000 clusters over the redshift range z {$\in$} [0.08, 0.55]. The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter {$\sigma$}z {$\approx$} 0.006 at z {$\approx$} 0.1, increasing to {$\sigma$}z {$\approx$} 0.02 at z {$\approx$} 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for |{$\Delta$}z|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low ({$\leqslant$}5\%).

The precision and accuracy of the cosmological parameters inferred from these objects are affected by the knowledge of cluster physics, entering the analysis through the mass-observable scaling relations, and the theoretical description of their mass and redshift distribution, modelled by the mass function. In this work we forecast the impact of different modelling of these ingredients for clusters detected by future optical and near-IR surveys. We consider the standard cosmological scenario and the case with a time-dependent equation of state for dark energy. We analyse the effect of increasing precision on the scaling relation calibration, finding improved constraints on the cosmological parameters. This higher precision exposes the impact of the mass function evaluation, which is a subdominant source of systematics for current data. We compare two different evaluations for the mass function. In both cosmological scenarios the use of different mass functions leads to biases in the parameter constraints. For the {$\Lambda$}CDM model, we find a 1.6{$\sigma$} shift in the ({$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m}, {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{8}) parameter plane and a discrepancy of {$\sim$}7{$\sigma$} for the redshift evolution of the scatter of the scaling relations. For the scenario with a time-evolving dark energy equation of state, the assumption of different mass functions results in a {$\sim$}8{$\sigma$} tension in the w\textsubscript{0} parameter. These results show the impact, and the necessity for a precise modelling, of the interplay between the redshift evolution of the mass function and of the scaling relations in the cosmological analysis of galaxy clusters.},

The precision on the cosmological constraints is affected mainly by the current knowledge of cluster physics, which enters the analysis through the scaling relations. Here we aim to study one of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties, the mass bias, \emph{b{$<$}i/{$>$}. We have analysed the effects of a mass-redshift dependence, adopting a power-law parametrisation. We applied this parametrisation to the combination of tSZ number counts and power spectrum, finding a hint of redshift dependence that leads to a decreasing value of the mass bias for higher redshift. We tested the robustness of our results for different mass bias calibrations and a discrete redshift dependence. We find our results to be dependent on the clusters sample that we are considering, in particular obtaining an inverse (decreasing) redshift dependence when neglecting \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.2 clusters. We analysed the effects of this parametrisation on the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and tSZ galaxy clusters. We find a preferred constant value of mass bias, having (1 - \emph{b{$<$}i/{$>$}) = 0.62 {$\pm$} 0.05. The corresponding value of \emph{b{$<$}i/{$>$} is too high with respect to weak lensing and numerical simulations estimations. Therefore we conclude that this mass-redshift parametrisation does not help in solving the remaining discrepancy between CMB and tSZ clusters observations.}}}}},

In this paper we use the same method of analysis already adopted in the Euclid Red Book, which is based on the Fisher matrix approach. Based on our analytical estimate of the cluster selection function in the photometric Euclid survey, we forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters corresponding to different extensions of the standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model. Using only Euclid clusters, we find that the amplitude of the matter power spectrum will be constrained to {$\Delta\sigma$}8 = 0.0014 and the mass density parameter to {$\Delta\Omega$}m = 0.0011. The dynamical evolution of dark energy will be constrained to {$\Delta$}w0 = 0.03 and {$\Delta$}wa = 0.2 with free curvature {$\Omega$}k, resulting in a (w0, wa) figure of merit (FoM) of 291. In combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints, the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity will be constrained to {$\Delta$}fNL {$\simeq$} 6.6 for the local shape scenario. The growth factor parameter {$\gamma$}, which signals deviations from general relativity, will be constrained to {$\Delta\gamma$} = 0.02, and the neutrino density parameter to {$\Delta\Omega\nu$} = 0.0013 (or {$\Delta\sum$}m{$\nu$} = 0.01). Including the Planck CMB covariance matrix improves dark energy constraints to {$\Delta$}w0 = 0.02, {$\Delta$}wa = 0.07, and a FoM = 802. Knowledge of the observable-cluster mass scaling relation is crucial to reach these accuracies. Imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of Euclid will enable internal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of cluster galaxies, supported by external cluster surveys.},

  abstract = {Parametric modeling of galaxy cluster density profiles from weak lensing observations leads to a mass bias, whose detailed understanding is critical in deriving accurate mass-observable relations for constraining cosmological models. Drawing from existing methods, we develop a robust framework for calculating this mass bias in one-parameter fits to simulations of dark matter halos. We show that our approach has the advantage of being independent of the absolute noise level, so that only the number of halos in a given simulation and the representativeness of the simulated halos for real clusters limit the accuracy of the bias estimation. While we model the bias as a log-normal distribution and the halos with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our method can be generalized to any bias distribution and parametric model of the radial mass distribution. We find that the log-normal assumption is not strictly valid in the presence of miscentring of halos. We investigate the use of cluster centers derived from weak lensing in the context of mass bias, and tentatively find that such centroids can yield sensible mass estimates if the convergence peak has a signal-to-noise ratio approximately greater than four. In this context we also find that the standard approach to estimating the positional uncertainty of weak lensing mass peaks using bootstrapping severely underestimates the true positional uncertainty for peaks with low signal-to-noise ratios. Though we determine the mass and redshift dependence of the bias distribution for a few experimental setups, our focus remains providing a general approach to computing such distributions.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

In particular, a technique for constraining models with a chameleon screening is introduced. In addition, the outlined technique is expanded to test a wider class of models, such as the theory of emergent gravity. Finally, the first part of the thesis is concluded by adapting the mentioned tests for model independent constraints. The obtained results indicate that galaxy clusters can be used to obtain some of the most powerful constraints on cosmological scales. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the topic of cosmological emulators. More specifically, a technique of emulating cosmological N-body simulation output data based on machine learning is introduced. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to emulate dark matter-only as well as hydrodynamical simulation data. In addition, N-body modified gravity simulations are explored as well. The presented investigation of the GAN algorithm shows that such emulators offer a powerful, fast and efficient way of producing simulation output data with different cosmological parameters. The power spectrum analysis indicates a 1-20\% difference between the training and the generated data depending on the dataset used and whether Gaussian smoothing is applied or not.},

  abstract = {Characterise the large-scale structure in the Universe from present  times to the high redshift epoch of reionisation is essential to constraining the cosmology, the history of star formation and reionisation, measuring the gas content of the Universe and obtaining a better understanding of the physical process that drive galaxy formation and evolution. Using the integrated emission from unresolved galaxies or gas clouds, line intensity mapping (LIM) provides a new observational window to measure the larger properties of structure. This very promising technique motivates the community to plan for LIM experiments. We describe the development of a large field-of-view instrument, named CONCERTO, operating in the range 130-310 GHz from the APEX 12-meters telescope. CONCERTO is a low-resolution spectrometer based on the Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors technology. Spectra are obtained using a fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), coupled to a dilution cryostat with base temperature of 0.1K. Two 2 kilo-pixels arrays of LEKID are mounted inside the cryostat that also contains the cold optics and the front-end electronics. We present in detail the technological choices leading to the instrumental concept, together with the design and fabrication of the instrument and preliminary laboratory tests on the detectors. We also give our best estimates of CONCERTO sensitivity and give predictions for two of the main scientific goals of CONCERTO, i.e. a [CII]-intensity mapping survey and observations of galaxy clusters. We provide a detail description of the instrument design. Based on realistic comparisons with existing instruments developed by our group (NIKA, NIKA2, and KISS), and on laboratory detectors characterisation, we provide an estimate of CONCERTO sensitivity on sky. Finally, we describe in detail two out of the main science goals offered by CONCERTO at APEX.},

  abstract = {We present a set of cluster models that link the present-day properties of clusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation. These models treat the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamental property. Because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient that rises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster depend entirely on its dark matter potential and the entropy distribution of its uncondensed gas. Guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropy distribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernova heating by assuming that the gas density distribution would be identical to that of the dark matter. The lowest entropy gas would then fall below a critical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a Hubble time. Radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify the entropy of that low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distribution function and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. Using some phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on the existence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set of cluster models. The surface brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, and luminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge from these models. By introducing a single adjustable parameter related to the amount of intracluster gas that can cool within a Hubble time, we can also reproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations of cooling flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.},

  abstract = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 1014 1015 M{$\odot$} , and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters, providing a context for interpreting the flood of new cluster observations that are now arriving from the latest generation of x-ray observatories, large optical surveys, and measurements of cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of ``dark energy'' with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ``Stage IV'' dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

  abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) and  other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analysed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}\^\{+1.7\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{km\textasciitilde s\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$ , a \$2.4\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of H0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in 3.1{$\sigma$} tension with Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3{$\sigma$} tension with Planck CMB determinations of H0 in flat {$\Lambda$}CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat {$\Lambda$}CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on H0 ranges from {$\sim$}73 to 78 km s-1 Mpc-1, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

We shall consider the distortions of the spectrum resulting from radiation during the recombination of a primeval plasma.

On the basis of the observational data it is concluded that a period of neutral hydrogen in the evolution of the universe is unavoidable. It is shown that any injection of energy att{$>$}1010 sec (red shiftz{$<$}105) leads to deviation from an equilibrium spectrum.},

  abstract = {Thanks to its outstanding angular resolution, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has recently unambiguously identified a population of optically dark galaxies with redshifts greater than \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 3, which play an important role in the cosmic star formation in massive galaxies. In this paper we study the properties of the six optically dark galaxies detected in the 69 arcmin\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} GOODS-ALMA 1.1 mm continuum survey. While none of them are listed in the deepest \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}-band based CANDELS catalog in the GOODS-South field down to \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$} = 28.16 AB, we were able to de-blend two of them from their bright neighbor and measure an \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}-band flux for them. We present the spectroscopic scan follow-up of five of the six sources with ALMA band 4. All are detected in the 2 mm continuum with signal-to-noise ratios higher than eight. One emission line is detected in AGS4 (\emph{{$\nu<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{obs{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 151.44 GHz with an \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} = 8.58) and AGS17 (\emph{{$\nu<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{obs{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 154.78 GHz with an \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} = 10.23), which we interpret in both cases as being due to the CO(6\textendash 5) line at = 3.556 and = 3.467, respectively. These redshifts match both the probability distribution of the photometric redshifts derived from the UV to near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the far-infrared SEDs for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these redshifts. We present evidence that nearly 70\% (4/6 of galaxies) of the optically dark galaxies belong to the same overdensity of galaxies at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\sim$} 3.5. overdensity The most massive one, AGS24 (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} = 10 ), is the most massive galaxy without an active galactic nucleus at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} 3 in the GOODS-ALMA field. It falls in the very center of the peak of the galaxy surface density, which suggests that the surrounding overdensity is a proto-cluster in the process of virialization and that AGS24 is the candidate progenitor of the future brightest cluster galaxy.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We present a new cosmological analysis of the galaxy clusters in the Planck MMF3 cosmology sample with a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing calibration of the cluster masses. As demonstrated by Planck, galaxy clusters detected via the Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (SZ) effect offer a powerful way to constrain cosmological parameters such as {$\Omega$}m and {$\sigma$}8. Determining the absolute cluster mass scale is, however, difficult, and some recent calibrations have yielded cosmological constraints in apparent tension with constraints in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model derived from the power spectra of the primary CMB anisotropies. In order to calibrate the absolute mass scale of the full Planck cluster sample, we remeasure the masses of all 433 clusters through their weak lensing signature in the CMB temperature anisotropies as measured by Planck. We perform a joint Bayesian analysis of the cluster counts and masses taking as input the estimated cluster masses, SZ signal-to-noise ratios, and redshifts. Our analysis properly accounts for selection effects in the construction of the cluster sample. We find {$\sigma$}8({$\Omega$}m/0.33)0.25 = 0.765~{$\pm~$}0.035 and \$1-b\_\{\textbackslash rm \{SZ\}\} = 0.71 \textbackslash pm 0.10\$, where the mass bias factor \$1-b\_\{\textbackslash rm \{SZ\}\}\$ relates cluster mass to the SZ mass that appears in the X-ray-calibrated cluster scaling relations. We find no evidence for tension with the Planck primary CMB constraints on {$\Lambda$}CDM model parameters.},

  abstract = {Matched filters are routinely used in cosmology in order to detect galaxy clusters from mm observations through their thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signature. In addition, they naturally provide an observable, the detection signal-to-noise or significance, which can be used as a mass proxy in number counts analyses of tSZ-selected cluster samples. In this work, we show that this observable is, in general, non-Gaussian, and that it suffers from a positive bias, which we refer to as optimisation bias. Both aspects arise from the fact that the signal-to-noise is constructed through an optimisation operation on noisy data, and hold even if the cluster signal is modelled perfectly well, no foregrounds are present, and the noise is Gaussian. After reviewing the general mathematical formalism underlying matched filters, we study the statistics of the signal-to-noise with a set Monte Carlo mock observations, finding it to be well-described by a unit-variance Gaussian for signal-to-noise values of 6 and above, and quantify the magnitude of the optimisation bias, for which we give an approximate expression that may be used in practice. We also consider the impact of the bias on the cluster number counts of Planck and the Simons Observatory (SO), finding it to be negligible for the former and potentially significant for the latter.},
